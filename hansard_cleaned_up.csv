To ask the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy whether the UK leaving the EU will affect the contracts to produce the payloads for the European Union Global Navigation satellite system in the UK.,The Joint Report issued by the UK and EU negotiating teams on 8 December was clear that UK entities would be able to continue to participate in all EU programmes including the space programmes financed by the current Multiannual Financial Framework which ends in 2020. Clearly there will be further discussions on exactly what this means for the individual programmes during Phase 2 of negotiations but the principle set out in the report is that eligibility of entities located in the UK will be unaffected by the UKs withdrawal from the EU. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether capital funding commitments for universities which have been agreed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England but not yet disbursed will be honoured by the Office for Students.,It is the Office for Students (OfS) intention that funding commitments agreed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England but not yet disbursed in full by 31 March 2018 will be honoured by the OfS and/or by UK Research and Innovation subject to monitoring arrangements and other terms and conditions of grant.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps his Department is taking to assist people from BAME backgrounds to be better represented in university arts courses and stage schools.,The Department for Culture Media and Sport has commissioned research to understand the existing barriers that prevent people from lower income households and under-represented groups such as those from Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds specifically from becoming professionals in the performing arts. It is important that the performing arts are representative of society as a whole. One of the ways this can be achieved is by doing more to ensure more people from BAME backgrounds go on to higher education. We now see record numbers of 18 year olds from all ethnicities entering full-time higher education according to data published by The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. However for some groups of students from ethnic minorities there is more to do to improve their participation - their retention success and progression to higher education. That is why the most recent guidance to the Director of Fair Access in February 2016 asked him to focus on activity to continue to improve access and participation into higher education for students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds.We are also introducing sweeping reforms through legislation. The Higher Education and Research Act includes the creation of the Office for Students which has a statutory duty to consider the promotion of equality of opportunity for students as it relates to access and participation. It also includes a transparency duty requiring all universities to publish applications offers acceptance and retention rates broken down by gender ethnicity and social economic background. This will help to hold universities to account for their records on access and retention.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what his Department's policy is on the no-platforming at universities of (a) Al-Muhajiroun (b) the British National Party (c) the English Defence League (d) Hizb-ut-Tahir (e) the Muslim Public Affairs Committee and (f) National Action; and if he will make a statement.,Al-Muhajiroun and National Action are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Membership is illegal and these groups should not be given a platform at universities. Universities have a legal duty to take reasonable steps to ensure freedom of speech including for visiting speakers (under the Education Act (No 2) 1986). The government therefore does not support blanket no-platforming of individuals or organisations who are legally exercising their right to freedom of speech; it is for universities to balance their legal duties on a case-by-case basis. The governments position on this issue has been publicly stated on a number of occasions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to the Consumer Rights Act 2015 what responsibilities the Office of Students will have to uphold the consumer rights of students.,Higher education providers (HEPs) can have responsibilities under consumer law including under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which should be discharged fully and policies and procedures should be in place to comply with the law. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published guidance to help HEPs understand and meet their obligations under consumer law. This guidance sets out that students should have access to clear specific and timely information; understandable fair and transparent terms and conditions; and clear and fair complaints handling processes. The government published a consultation on behalf of the new Office for Students (OfS) regarding the regulation of the higher education sector which closed on the 22 December 2017. The consultation includes a proposal that the OfS will require registered higher education providers in the approved and approved (fee cap) categories to demonstrate that in developing their policies and procedures governing their contractual and other relationships with students they have given due regard to relevant guidance such as that of CMA as to how to comply with consumer law. A response will be published in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 9 January 2018 to Question 120227 what assessment he has made of the effect of his proposals for two-year university courses on the ability of students to seek part-time employment during term-time alongside studying to fund their living costs.,Accelerated degree courses generally require study at the same intensity in hours per week as their standard degree equivalents. Accelerated study is achieved by increasing the number of weeks studied per year rather than the number of hours per week. As such we would expect students on such courses to be as able to work part-time work during term time as students on traditional programmes. The proposed arrangements for living cost support are set out in the consultation on accelerated degrees which closes on 11 February and we will consider any relevant evidence in the responses we receive to that consultation.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if he will publish the (a) scope (b) timetable and (c) membership the review panel for the review of university funding and student financing announced by the Prime Minister in her speech to the Conservative Party Conference in October 2017.,As stated in the Industrial Strategy white paper published on 27 November 2017 the government is committed to conducting a major review of funding across tertiary education to ensure a joined-up system that works for everyone. As current and significant reforms move into implementation this review will look at how we can ensure that the education system for those aged 18 years and over is:<ul>accessible to all;supported by a funding system that provides value for money and works for both students and taxpayers;incentivises choice and competition across the sector; andencourages the development of the skills that we need as a country.</ul> The government will set out further details on the review in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the timetable is to fill the vacancy on the board of the Office for Students.,The resignation of Toby Young from the board of the Office for Students (OfS) will not prevent it from carrying out its responsibilities. The appointments to the board reflect the diverse needs of the higher education sector young people and employers. The OfS board's broad range of skills and experience across the field of education will ensure it is able to deliver for students. We will look to replace Toby Young in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many candidates interviewed for appointment to the Board of the Office for Students scored more highly at interview than Toby Young.,The interview panel did not rank the appointable candidates. Following the interviews they presented ministers with the list of appointable candidates and those that were deemed not appointable alongside a summary of their strengths as demonstrated at interview.
To ask the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy what estimate his Department has made of the yearly gross amount of public funding currently being invested in health research.,"We do not hold data for total Departmental spend on health research.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps his Department has taken to encourage Universities UK to resolve the dispute over the Universities Superannuation Scheme.,Universities are autonomous institutions and they are responsible for their own pension provision. The department has not taken steps to encourage Universities UK or any other party to resolve the dispute regarding the Universities Superannuation Scheme but continues to monitor developments.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to Guardian article published on 26 December 2017 entitled Jo Johnson to tell universities to stop no-platforming speakers which universities have removed books from university libraries due to the inclusion of trigger words.,In the speech which resulted in this article my Rt hon. Friend the Minister of State for Universities Science Research and Innovation gave two distinct examples of threats to freedom of speech Ò the removal of ÷offensive material from libraries and the drawing up of lists of ÷trigger words. He did not state that books were being removed due to the inclusion of trigger words.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many candidates were (a) considered (b) shortlisted and (c) interviewed for positions on the board of the Office for Students; and if she will make a statement.,Two parallel open recruitment campaigns were held in the second half of 2017; one for Office for Students board members and a second specifically for a student experience board member. The campaigns generated 221 applications for the non-executive board member positions and 133 applications for the Student Experience representative. Some applicants responded to both campaigns. 17 candidates were shortlisted across the two campaigns and of those 16 were subsequently interviewed with one candidate choosing to withdraw. My Rt hon. Friend the Minister of State for Universities Science Research and Innovation responded to questions in the House of Commons on this subject on 8 January 2018.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what criteria were used to assess the suitability of candidates for the board of the Office for Students.,The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 requires that the Office for Students must have a Chair a Chief Executive Officer a Director for Fair Access and Participation and between seven and 12 ordinary members. Schedule 1 of the Act sets out criteria for ministers to have regard to in making appointments.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what consideration was given to statements on the public record made by candidates and the effect of those statements on the (a) operation and (b) standing of the Office for Students during the recruitment process for members of the board of the Office for Students.,A degree of due diligence took place ahead of all the appointments. However neither Panel members nor the department were aware of certain comments by Toby Young before his appointment was made. These remarks were years in some cases decades in the past. The Commissioner for Public Appointments the right hon. Peter Riddell has recently suggested that departments need to look at how they undertake due diligence. The government will be carefully considering this issue in light of his advice.

Please note that some applicants responded to both campaigns. 11 candidates were shortlisted for interview for the non-executive board member positions. Ten interviews were held as one candidate did not attend the interview.six candidates were shortlisted and interviewed for the student experience board member position. Ten candidates were deemed appointable for the non-executive board member positions. Three candidates were deemed appointable for the student experience board member position.

To ask the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy with reference to The Patents and Patents (Fees) (Amendment) Rules 2017 what assessment has made of the potential effect of the increase in fees on the number of patent applications.,"The fee changes are being made after a full public consultation and Impact Assessment (<a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-statutory-patents-fees\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-statutory-patents-fees</a>). Past experience has shown that previous fee increases have resulted in small or no changes in the number of patent applications. The new fees remain modest but are designed to encourage businesses and in particular individuals to consider carefully Ò before they apply Ò whether patent protection will be of benefit to them. We therefore expect to see a decrease in the number of speculative applications and applications with little chance of successfully being granted a patent. The Impact Assessment modelled a 10% decrease in the number of applications on this basis but no decrease is expected in the number of valid patents being granted to innovators. This will ensure that valuable patent examiner resources can be more focussed on patent applications with a prospect of success to the benefit of innovative businesses. """
To ask the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy what representations he has received on researchers being excluded from EU research projects as a result of the UKs decision to leave the EU; and if he will provide a breakdown of those representations by academia and industry.,"The Government is committed to ensuring the best possible outcomes for UK Science and Research as we exit the European Union. Following the referendum we set up a dedicated mailbox (<a href=\mailto:research@beis.gov.uk\"" target=\""_blank\"">research@beis.gov.uk</a>) to allow academics researchers and others with an interest to register any issues experienced in engaging with European activities. Since the announcement of the government underwrite of funding the number of representations received has been low. Stakeholders have largely been in touch to seek clarification Ò both on the extent of the funding guarantee and on the eligibility of UK applicants to continue participating in EU research projects after exit Ò rather than to report cases of discrimination.The Joint Report published by the UK and EU negotiating teams on 8th December 2017 and agreed by the European Council makes clear that as part of the overall withdrawal agreement the UKs right to participate in EU programmes including Horizon 2020 will be unaffected by the UKs withdrawal from the EU.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education  To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the reason is for the difference in the repayment thresholds for Plan 1 and Plan 2 loan schemes.,Plan 1 and Plan 2 income contingent repayment student loans are separate loan products with different terms and conditions including different interest rates repayment thresholds and write-off periods.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education for what reason students with a Student Loan living in countries with higher tax rates are subject to a lower repayment threshold than students living in the UK.,The repayment of student loans is governed by the Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) Regulations 2009 (as amended). All borrowers including those resident in the UK and overseas are liable to make student loan repayments calculated on the basis of pre-tax income.Overseas repayment thresholds are calculated using World Bank cost of living data (which is used to compare differences between the cost of living in the UK and other countries) not the tax rates of countries of residence. This means that if a borrower is resident in a country calculated as having a lower cost of living than the UK the repayment threshold applied to their loan will be lower than would be the case if they were residing in the UK.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education for what reasons the Student Loan repayment rate is calculated using gross salary levels.,The repayment of student loans is governed by the Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) Regulations 2009 (as amended). The amount that a borrower is required to repay is calculated on the basis of income subject to National Insurance contributions (for UK-resident PAYE borrowers) or income subject to tax (for borrowers required to complete a Self Assessment Tax form or borrowers resident overseas). This provides equal treatment of borrowers. An individuals effective tax rate can be dependent on a variety of factors such as investment income or pension contributions and does not provide a simple link to earnings.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the selection criteria were for positions on the board of the Office for Students.,The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 requires that the Office for Students (OfS) must have a Chair a Chief Executive Officer a Director for Fair Access and Participation and between seven and 12 ordinary members. At least one of these ordinary members must have experience of representing or promoting the interests of students individually or generally on higher education courses provided by higher education providers. The Higher Education and Research Act (Schedule 1 S2(2)) sets out criteria for ministers to have regard to in making appointments.The selection criteria were published in the applicant packs which were available on the Cabinet Office Public Appointments website for the duration of the campaign.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what progress has been made on the implementation of a smoking ban on the prison estate in England and Wales.,There are now 68 prisons smoke free. More prisons across England are currently preparing for the safe implementation of a smoke free environment during the next six months. All prisons in Wales are already smoke free. In every prison the decision on when to go smoke free is only taken after careful planning and preparation to ensure it is operational safe to do so and all necessary healthcare support is available to help prisoners give up smoking.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made on the effect of the implementation of the smoking ban in prisons on order and discipline in those prisons.,The Government remains fully committed to making all prisons smoke free. The decision to go smoke free in every prison is only taken after careful planning and preparation (Readiness Assessments); and the final decision is only taken when each prison has met stringent checks to ensure that it is safe to do so and all necessary healthcare support is available to help prisoners give up smoking. Maintaining order and control in our prisons is our priority and this large-scale project has been actively managed under usual project management disciplines.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to protect prison officers from exposure to new psychoactive substances.,HMPPS priority is to reduce any potential use or secondary exposure to Psychoactive Substances (PS) by drug supply prevention reduction and detection. Intelligence and security procedures are available to activate strategies including lock-down searches and the use of dog teams to detect and reduce supply. Co-operation and liaison with police and CPS at local and national level is also ongoing to work on prosecutions and supply intelligence. In October health and safety guidance was published which brought together existing procedures for the control of exposure to all airborne contaminants in prisons. In order to establish an evidence-base for reported exposures to staff experts have been appointed to undertake air sampling to identify and assess concentrations if any of PS in prison wings and this program is due to start as a pilot in one prison in January 2018. HMPPS continues to monitor and investigate apparent adverse effects of PS exposure and to seek to ensure that methods to reduce supply are fully implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if his Department will publish the HMPPS investigation into the concerted indiscipline at HMP Long Lartin on 11 October 2017.,We do not publish the Investigation reports into incidents of concerted indiscipline. The information could allow prisoners to adapt their behaviour in a way that could undermine or circumvent any recommendations within the reports. This would impact negatively on the Prison and Probation Services (HMPPS) ability to implement changes to security processes and procedures which will in turn increase the threat to good order and discipline and staff safety.

To ask the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy what mechanisms his Department uses to share best practice with other Government Departments on including provisions on affordable access in research and development grants.,This Government supports open access to research publications following the Finch Report in 2012 and further advice from Professor Adam Tickell in 2016. It is for the Research Councils and Funding Councils (and soon UK Research and Innovation) to implement open access within their arrangements for grants and other instruments. The Research Councils make available block grants to enable universities to make publications arising from their research open access. Best practice in this regard is for research publications to be open access that is freely available for all to read on the internet and for research data to be ÏFAIR. We support the recent G7 communique that proposes that Ïresearch data should adhere to the FAIR principles of being findable accessible interoperable and reusable. This does not mean that such data should always be open as there are circumstances in which that would not be appropriate for example where personal confidentiality or national security might be put at risk. Best practice is shared with other Government departments primarily through the work of the Government Office for Science and the Chief Scientific Advisors in Government departments across Whitehall. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if his Department will conduct an assessment of the range of reports issued by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons in England and Wales compared with the reports issued by its counterpart bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.,The role of the widely respected inspectorates in England and Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland is critical in ensuring that there is an objective and challenging assessment of individual prisons and criminal justice systems. There are a range of reports that are issued by these independent scrutiny bodies including inspection reports annual reports thematic reports monitoring reports and action plan reviews. Some of these reports are joint publications for example Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland and Her Majestys Inspectorate of Prisons recently conducted an inspection of HMP Magilligan which was published on 12<sup>th</sup> December 2017. We are always looking at ways to maximise the impact of independent scrutiny on our prisons to improve the outcomes for prisoners. The Inspectorates are independent and it is for them to consider how best to share their learning and best practice.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of  14 December to Question 118432 how many times a Contract Management Team has notified a Community Rehabilitation Company that its staffing level is insufficient.,This Question has been interpreted as asking whether Contract Management Teams (CMTs) have formally notified Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) that staffing levels are too low and that action should be taken to increase staffing. I can confirm that over the last 12 months CMTs have not formally notified any CRCs to take action to increase staffing levels. The contracts with CRCs require each CRC to ensure that it employs a sufficient level of staff and that its workforce is competent and adequately trained. Our CMTs closely monitor and robustly manage providers on a local basis taking into account the regional context to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to reduce reoffending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether he has undertaken a risk assessment of the unplanned closures of sections of prisons as a result of insufficient availability of staff.,Governors and senior operational staff in prisons proactively manage the risk of unplanned closures and the effects on safety staffing levels and delivery of effective regimes. The regime management plan was developed specifically to provide a tool to assist in this.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many category B prisoners are being held in category C prisons.,All prisoners are individually assessed as to their risk of escape or abscond their risk of harm to the public should they escape or abscond and their risk to the good order of the establishment. This ensures categorisation of prisoners to a prison providing an appropriate level of security. Only those prisoners categorised as C would be held in a category C prison and only those considered suitable would be held in category D open conditions. No category B prisoners are held in category D prisons. Prisoners must be risk assessed as suitable for Category D/open conditions before allocation to an open establishment. Category B prisoners are not routinely held in Category C prisons. If after reassessment a Category C prisoner is required to transfer to a Category B prison they are usually held in a segregation unit pending transfer to a suitable Category B establishment. On 13 December 2017 there were 20 such prisoners. The correct categorisation and allocation balancing security issues and the needs of the prisoner helps prisoners to use their sentences constructively to tackle their offending behaviour and to prepare for their eventual release. All prisoners must be placed in the category consistent with the needs of security and control and the need to protect the public. Prisoners of a higher security category would not as a matter of course be held in an establishment of a lower category. The only exceptions to this will be where prisoners are re-categorised and then await a move to a different establishment.

In October family budgets were devolved to Governors which coincided with the commencement of new family services contracts. This has given Governors the necessary levers to deliver tailored support for prisoners helping them to build or maintain family ties or develop alternative relationships.Relationships between prisoners their family or significant others and children are maintained through a range of visiting opportunities. In addition to the statutory entitlement to visits under the Prison Rules 1999 prisoners may also be granted additional visits through local privilege schemes.Release on temporary licence (ROTL) is another way for suitable prisoners to maintain family ties and we will be exploring in the coming months how best to ensure access to ROTL for those who would benefit within a robust risk assessment framework.A new Family Policy Framework will be published during 2018 to help standardise the quality of services provided across all prisons to help strengthen relationships between prisoners their family and significant relationships."""

In the event of a medical emergency a man may be transferred to local services if care cannot be provided within HMP Berwyn but men are transferred back to the prison at the earliest appropriate opportunity. A risk assessment will decide the level of staffing required for the safe transfer to hospital and during any further hospital stay. This will be completed before any move to hospital from HMP Berwyn except in an emergency. The risk assessment is approved by the Head of Security or the person operationally in charge of the prison.

The reason for the comparative budget reduction is that HR Directorate have held onto £0.2k budget for Facilities Management costs within the Learning &amp; Development Unit and the average pay used to set the pay budget allocation for 17/18 was based on average costs which are £7k lower than in previous years and will need to be adjusted next year to reflect Operational rather than HQ posts of approx. £0.41m.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the Government has any plans to introduce a mandatory retirement age for prison officers.,There are no plans to introduce a mandatory retirement age for prison officers. For Government to consider introducing a mandatory pension age would require a change to legislation and as the Civil Service Pension covers a number of government departments and agencies any legislative change to the scheme would affect all members of the Civil Service Pension and not just prison officers. Members of the Civil Service Pension scheme are able to apply for retirement at any time after reaching the age of 55. However their pension would be actuarially reduced to take into account the fact that their pension benefits would be paid for longer due to taking early retirement. Introducing a mandatory retirement age for prison officers could lead to potential age discrimination claims being brought against the service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the answer of 4 December to Question 116620 how many of the 2718 prisoners serving  Imprisonment Public Protection sentences who have passed their minimum tariff period have parole hearings scheduled for the next six months; and will he make a statement.,In my evidence to the Justice Select Committee on 18 October I outlined the work that Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) was undertaking to provide as many opportunities for IPP prisoners to progress to safe release as soon as possible. This includes giving IPP prisoners the support opportunities and motivation they need to progress more quickly. We are also working towards opening three new IPP Progression Regimes that build on the success of the one at HMP Warren Hill which is providing opportunities for IPP prisoners to reduce their risk where they have struggled to do so previously. HMPPS is targeting those who have had two or more unsuccessful parole hearings and carrying out psychology-led case reviews to identify new approaches to improve the prospects of achieving progression. The Parole Board is also committed to progressing IPP prisoners towards release by providing IPP prisoners with timely access to parole reviews. Already this year the numbers of IPP prisoners has reduced from 3528 to 3162. Of the 2718 IPP prisoners - who have passed their minimum tariff period - 746 have oral hearings scheduled during the period 1 December 2017 - 31 March 2018. The Parole Board - which is listing more cases than ever - lists cases three months in advance and I expect that further oral hearings for IPP prisoners will be listed during the next six months. The Parole Boards aim is that IPP prisoners should be released - if it is safe to do so - or have clear plans in place that will enable them to progress.

Of these prisoners 2718 have passed their minimum tariff period.These and other statistics specific to those serving indeterminate sentences are published quarterly by the Ministry of Justice here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/offender-management-statistics-quarterly\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/offender-management-statistics-quarterly</a> I remain committed to ensuring IPP prisoners are able to progress towards release as soon it is safe to do so after their tariff has expired. IPP prisoners are achieving release in high numbers. In the year 2016/17 46% of IPP prisoners achieved a release decision from the Parole Board with a further 24% securing a progressive move to open conditions. Less than a third of hearings resulted in a negative outcome. A joint action plan is in place co-owned by Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) and the Parole Board with the specific aim of providing as many opportunities for IPP prisoners to progress to safe release as soon as possible. A key part of the action plan has been to ensure that the parole process runs as smoothly as possible so as to provide IPP prisoners with timely access to parole reviews. The Parole Board has effectively eliminated its backlog and is now listing more hearings than ever before."""

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people convicted of war crimes are detained in the UK; and how many people have been so detained in the last 10 years?,The United Kingdom has sentence enforcement agreements with a number of international courts and tribunals. Under these arrangements the UK is currently holding one person convicted of war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Previously three prisoners convicted of war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have served all or part of their sentence in the United Kingdom in the last 10 years. A further prisoner convicted by ICTY was held here prior to this period. These four prisoners are no longer detained in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the number of prisoners who are (a) in employment and (b) housed as a result of the Government's resettlement policies.,We do not hold exact data on the numbers of prisoners currently in employment on release. Matched MOJ-DWP data indicates that 17% of those released from custody in 2011/12 were in P45 employment one year after release. More recent data from 2014/15 indicates that at a national level 26.5% of prisoners were entering employment upon release but this data was self-reported.Supporting offenders into meaningful employment is a vital part of the Governments approach to tackling reoffending. That is why we are working to better link skills and training in prison to employment on release. We will also continue to drive innovative employment programmes like the Prisoner Apprenticeship Pathway where prisoners will receive high quality employer-led training and work experience in custody that leads to a guaranteed apprenticeship on release and the New Futures Network (NFN) that will support empowered governors to broker relationships between prisons and employers more effectively. Initiatives like these coupled with work to incentivise employers to work with ex-offenders will all help ensure offenders have the best chance of securing employment immediately on release.We currently do not have comprehensive and accurate figures on the number of offenders with different types of accommodation needs both on entry to prison and on release. Nevertheless in the year ending March 2017 70% of offenders released during 2016/17 excluding those released in London to the supervision of the Community Rehabilitation Companies were settled in accommodation whether in permanent housing with family or friends or in supported housing or hostels. The remaining 30% were released with either unknown or unsettled accommodation outcomes. We are committed to improving accommodation outcomes for offenders on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many additional days of imprisonment were imposed as punishment on prisoners at HM Prison Bedford during 2016?,The number of additional days awarded to prisoners at HM Prison Bedford as a result of adjudications in 2016 was 26. Discipline procedures are central to the maintenance of a safe custodial environment. They are provided for by the Prison and Young Offender Institution Rules which require adjudications to be conducted lawfully fairly and justly. Independent Adjudicators are District Judges or Deputy District Judges who attend prisons and young offender institutions when necessary to hear those adjudication cases which are deemed to be sufficiently serious. Such cases may merit a punishment of additional days to a prisoners time spent in custody if the prisoner or young person is found guilty. Only Independent Adjudicators can make an award of additional days as a punishment. The most serious offences will be referred to the Police.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many incidents relating to Spice have been recorded at HM Prison Berwyn since that prison opened in Spring 2017.,The Ministry of Justice and <em>Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HM</em>PPS) takes seriously the ongoing challenges that substance misuse including psychoactive substances (PS) pose to our establishments and we continue to implement a range of measures to address both the availability and use of such harmful substances. This is based on a multi-agency approach working closely with health partners and law enforcement agencies. The HMPPS Incident Reporting System does not specifically record the reasons behind an incident and therefore it is not possible to provide the information requested. Prisons have at their disposal a range of security measures to reduce the supply of drugs into prisons including physical searching the use of x-ray machines CCTV surveillance cameras intelligence-led searches as well as drug detection dogs. HMPPS have trained more than 300 dogs to detect PS and these dogs are available to all prisons. HMPPS are also exploring additional innovative security measures and new technology to complement existing searching methods in prisons. The introduction of mandatory drug testing for psychoactive substances in prisons in September 2016 was also a significant step to support our prisons in tackling the supply and use of these lethal drugs. We are not aware of any other prison service in the world that has introduced these innovative new tests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether a risk assessment was conducted by his Department on the smoking ban in prisons before the roll-out of that ban.,The Government remains fully committed to making all prisons smoke free. The decision to go smoke free in every prison is only taken after careful planning and preparation and the final decision is only taken when each prison has met stringent checks to ensure that it is safe to do so and all necessary healthcare support is available to help prisoners give up smoking. The national roll out of the Smoke Free Prisons project has been actively managed under usual project management disciplines.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the level of use of synthetic drugs in prisons in each of the the last three years.,<ul>Psychoactive substances are a significant driver of violence and instability in prisons. We have put in place a range of supply and demand reduction measures to address the availability and use of such harmful substances. This is based on a multi-agency approach working closely with health partners and law enforcement agencies. We are the first prison jurisdiction in the world to have developed a test for psychoactive substances and have trained more than 300 sniffer dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances. We have invested £3m in enhancing our intelligence capability to identify the organised crime groups and individuals behind supply routes and are using this intelligence to work with the police to disrupt them.Figures drawn from the HMPPS Incident Reporting System suggest there were just under 10000 incidents where psychoactive substances were found in prisons between October 2015 and October 2017 in England and Wales. Data prior to October 2015 cannot be provided as this is when a new incident type was introduced to the Incident Reporting System.Testing for psychoactive substances was only in place across the whole prison estate from September 2016 onwards. Between October 2016 and March 2017 there were 27277 random mandatory drug tests administered. Each sample taken is tested for a range of illicit drugs including psychoactive substances. As these are random drugs tests prisoners tested in a single month are unique but an individual prisoner could be chosen in multiple months. Figures for 2017/18 will be published in the Annual HMPPS Digest in July 2018.</ul>

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when he plans to publish the results of the Government's review of the latest draft clauses on the discount rate reforms.,The Justice Select Committee is conducting a pre-legislative scrutiny inquiry into the draft legislation published by the Ministry of Justice on 7 September (Cm 9500). The Government will respond to the Committees conclusions and other comments received on the draft legislation within two months of the publication of the Committees report. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 16 November 2017 to Question 111777 on prisoners: Russia whether he has had made representations to the Russian embassy on the repatriation of Russian passport holders held in UK prisons.,We have made no such representations. Both the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation are signatories to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prison officers inadvertently consumed narcotics in prison in each year since 2010.,HM Prison &amp; Probation Service does not have a staff drug testing policy and therefore does not have the information requested. We are committed to ensuring the health safety and wellbeing of our staff and have a zero tolerance supported by tough new laws to deal with people smuggling banned substances into jails and we are clear that those caught with banned items will be dealt with appropriately.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment his Department has made of the effect of the implementation of a smoking ban on narcotics use in prisons.,Guidance has been developed in conjunction with Public Health England to provide information and practical advice to staff to assist with managing the potential risks associated with narcotics. There are strategies in place to reduce the supply of narcotics and detection of all psychotic substances (PS). This include the empowerment and training of staff to tackle PS use. We have also taken swift action to stop the supply of drugs into all our prisons equipping all prisons with portable and fixed detectors to tackle illicit use of phones in prisons. We are working with the police to catch and convict criminal using drones to smuggle contraband into prisons and are testing physical and technological countermeasures to stop incursions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his Department plans to test waste water from prisons for illegal substances.,In the Prison Safety and Reform White paper published in November 2016 the Ministry of Justice committed to strengthen measures to enhance our drug testing regime in prisons this included increasing the frequency and range of drugs tested for. Waste water testing is one of the options under consideration alongside other innovative technologies.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many confiscated drugs found in prisons have been tested in each year since 2010.,We take a zero-tolerance approach to drugs in our prisons. Anyone found with contraband will be subject to disciplinary action and police investigation. We are taking unprecedented action to stop the supply and use of drugs including an innovative new drug testing programme and have over 300 dogs to detect psychoactive substances. We have also invested £3 million in enhanced intelligence to improve our targeted intelligence and search capabilities. We are working closely with government partners to address issues with drugs at every stage of the supply chain including those attempting to smuggle drugs into prisons. In this case the information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. This is because Prison-NOMIS does not normally contain this data in a consistent format and much of the data is held at a local level. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many staff have been employed in each private prison in each year since 2010.,This table displays the number of funded posts at each privately managed prison on 1 January in each year where data is available. <table><tbody>Prison20172016201520142013201220112010Altcourse393.21393433424436488488488Ashfield152165169171Not AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableBirmingham499.5500499497476521486 Bronzefield332.79369354355348355367369Doncaster406.48399392399382404590590Dovegate526516511524540539549543Forest Bank573576576548548548Not AvailableNot AvailableLowdham Grange406.6427.5413.5407.1Not AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableOakwood464.97498439439441437  Parc718.3716720663672653694593Peterborough618.01604.51591.91518.97532.24551.45534.45Not AvailableRye Hill257255256250244246258259Thameside406406351351351   Northumberland408.3398.7394.5378    </tbody></table> The shaded areas on the table indicate that a prison was not open in that year (Oakwood Thameside and Northumberland) or that the prison was operated by the public sector at that time (Birmingham).

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what progress he has made in reducing the abuse of personal injury whiplash claims for incidents involving motor vehicles.,The Governments whiplash reforms in recent years have included improving the independence and quality of whiplash medical reports through the introduction of the MedCo system in 2015 as well as reducing and fixing the cost of those reports.In February this year following consultation the Government announced further reforms to help bear down on the number and cost of claims. Those reforms that require primary legislation will be introduced through a Civil Liability Bill which was announced in the Queens Speech. They are:<ul>the introduction of a fixed tariff of compensation for pain suffering and loss of amenity for whiplash claims with a duration of up to two years; and</ul><ul>banning the practice of seeking or offering to settle such claims without medical evidence.</ul>In addition secondary legislative rule changes will bring the vast majority of whiplash claims into the small claims track.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment his Department has made of the prevalence of online anonymity network usage amongst convicted offenders.,<table><tbody>The illicit use of mobile phones undermines the security and safety of prisons and enables criminals to access the internet. We are aware of this threat and the risk that prisoners may attempt to use anonymising encryption software. We are taking urgent and decisive action to tackle the issue of mobile phones as the number of devices seized continues to be too high. We have invested £2million into detection equipment including hand-held detectors and portable detection devices. We are also working with mobile network operators to deliver ground-breaking technology which will stop mobiles smuggled into prisons from working.</tbody></table>
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his Department plans to build new private prisons.,The Government set out its ambition for a reformed prison estate in the November 2016 Prison Safety and Reform White Paper. Our reforms will close down ageing and ineffective prisons and replace them with buildings fit for todays demands. The new prison estate will create the physical conditions for Governors to achieve better educational training and rehabilitation outcomes. No decision has yet been made on who will operate the new prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what is the Government's estimate of (a) baseline certified normal accommodation and (b) operational capacity in England and Wales following the completion of the new for old prison regeneration and building plan.,Following completion of the population build up at HMP Berwyn and delivery of a new houseblock at HMP Stocken the capacity of the prison estate is currently forecast to remain stable at approximately 80300 certified normal accommodation and 88300 operational capacity from 2019 onwards. The Government set out its ambition for a reformed prison estate in the November 2016 Prison Safety and Reform White Paper. Our reforms will close down ageing and ineffective prisons and replace them with buildings fit for todays demands. The new prison estate will create the physical conditions for Governors to achieve better educational training and rehabilitation outcomes. The delivery dates for this programme have not yet been set so the impact is not yet included in capacity forecasts.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 13 November 2017 to Question 122018 on Community Rehabilitation Companies; staff whether any community rehabilitation company contract contains an obligation to employ a specified minimum number of staff.,As per the answer to Question 122018 none of the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) contracts specify that CRCs must maintain staffing numbers at a particular level. Public protection is our top priority and CRCs must ensure they have sufficient levels of competent and appropriately trained staff to deliver their contractual obligations. We continue to closely monitor CRCs as part of our robust contract management and assurance process.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many offenders were given community sentences in North Wales in each year for which data is available.,The number of offenders given community sentences in the North Wales Police Force area from 1992 to 2016 can be viewed in the table attached. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to improve the performance of Working Links Ltd and BGSW Community Rehabilitation Company as a result of the report from HM Inspectorate of Probation on Community Rehabilitation Company activity in Gloucestershire published on 31 August 2017.,There is a contractual mechanism for dealing with recommendations made in HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and as a result we expect Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) to action all HMI Probation recommendations where reasonably practicable. Contract Management Teams give high priority to ensuring that these are followed through and ensure that the actions are successful in addressing the points raised. Public protection is our top priority and we will take all necessary action to make sure the probation system is reducing reoffending and preventing future victims.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many community rehabilitation companies have a role in probation services; and what the (a) location (b) length of contract and (c) cost of contract is for each such company.,"Under the probation reforms 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) were established to deliver rehabilitation services in England and Wales to low and medium risk offenders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what meetings he has had with the London Community Rehabilitation Company on recent reports that 15000 appointments have been missed by offenders; and what plans he has to tackle that issue.,Senior officials regularly meet with London CRC to hold them to account for delivery including through actions of the HMPPS Contract Management Team. The performance of London Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) has been below our expectations. That is why a taskforce was established in 2016 as a result of the concerns raised by our contract compliance team and HMI Probation. Since then London CRC has developed a comprehensive action plan and bolstered its senior leadership. They have revised their staffing structures to ensure that caseloads are manageable and robust action is being taken in relation to under-performance. Further work is also being carried out by HMPPS Contract Management team to drive better performance in the area of enforcement across all CRC contracts. Public protection is our top priority and we will take all necessary action to make sure the probation system is reducing reoffending and preventing future victims.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he plans to take to address the current prison population already being greater than the projected numbers for each year through to 2020.,In August 2017 the Ministry of Justice published its annual Prison Population Projections bulletin 2017 to 2022. As at 10th November the total prison population was 86163 which is well within our published range for November 2017. Prison numbers can fluctuate which is why we have a robust set of plans in place to ensure we will always have enough places for offenders committed to custody by the courts. This includes modernising the estate and building new accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans his Department has to increase the number of prison governor and managerial level staff at pay bands seven to 11 in each of the next two years.,The Government is already taking action to ensure that all prisons are staffed appropriately at all levels to ensure that they are safe. We are on target to recruit an additional 2500 Prison Officers by December 2018 to improve safety and offender management in custody. We have also introduced new schemes to attract top graduates and former servicemen and women into the service as well as new schemes to move talented internal candidates into managerial roles. HMPPS has recently changed the internal assessment processes for Head of Function roles (Band 7 and Band 8 staff) to speed up the selection processes. Since this change over 70 staff are now accredited to take up Head of Function roles. There are planned internal assessments throughout 2018 to be able to meet demand. There are also plans to reinvigorate the selection processes for Governor posts (at Bands 10 and 11) which will again run through 2018 to meet demand. Since April 2017 Governors have been empowered to manage workforce planning locally and use this flexibility to set their own staffing arrangements.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans the Government has to extend to other areas intensive alternatives to Custody programmes such as the scheme piloted in Greater Manchester as an alternative to short custodial sentences.,The courts already have the flexibility to select a range of requirements which are both a robust alternative to custody and provide opportunities to address the specific issues which contribute to a risk of re-offending. Courts may select particular requirements to deal with an individual offender or authorise a bespoke package such as the Intensive Community Order provided by the local Community Rehabilitation Company in Greater Manchester. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment his Department has made of the effect on managing the incident at HMP Long Lartin in October 2017 the difference between (a) actual staffing levels and (b) benchmark staffing targets at that prison.,The concerted indiscipline that took place at HMP Long Lartin on 11 October is currently subject to an ongoing internal HMPPS investigation. This will establish the facts in relation to this incident and any identifiable cause or contributory factor.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment the Government has made of the potential merits of using private finance for the building of new prisons.,We will modernise the prison estate closing older prisons that are not fit for purpose and creating in their place high-quality modern establishments. This will help deliver prisons that are more safe and secure so our staff can work more closely with offenders to change their lives and turn their back on crime for good. No decisions have been made as to whether there is a role for private finance in the building of any new prisons in England and Wales.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to support the principle of 100 per cent compensation in civil justice cases.,The Government is committed to the principle that people injured through the negligence of others should receive full and fair compensation.On 7 September the Ministry of Justice published and invited comments on draft legislation that would change the way in which the personal injury discount rate set by the Lord Chancellor for England and Wales under section 1 of the Damages Act 1996 is set.The changes would create a better and fairer framework for the setting of the rate and would better support the 100% compensation rule by providing a more accurate estimate of the return to be expected on investments. The Justice Select Committee is conducting a pre-legislative scrutiny inquiry into the draft legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to publish the outcome of the Ogden discount rate consultation.,The personal injury discount rate set by the Lord Chancellor for England and Wales under section 1 of the Damages Act 1996 was reduced from 2.5% to minus 0.75% on 20 March following a review. The Lord Chancellor is required by law to make sure the rate is not inappropriate. On 7 September the Ministry of Justice published and invited comments on draft legislation that would change the way in which the discount rate is set. The Justice Select Committee is conducting a pre-legislative scrutiny inquiry into the draft legislation. The Government will respond to the Committees conclusions and other comments received on the draft legislation within two months of the publication of the Committees report.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the cost to (a) the public purse and (b) insurance companies was of the Ogden rate change of March 2017.,The personal injury discount rate set by the Lord Chancellor for England and Wales under section 1 of the Damages Act 1996 was reduced from 2.5% to minus 0.75% on 20 March following a review. The impact on the public sector of the change to the rate in March is estimated at £1.2bn per annum. The Government has not made an estimate of the overall impact on the insurance industry. However the Office for Budget Responsibilitys economic and fiscal outlook in March 2017 indicated that the Prudential Regulation Authority estimated as at 27 February 2017 (the date of the Lord Chancellors announcement of the forthcoming change to the rate) that the cost to insurers would be around £2 billion a year albeit with a wide range of uncertainty around that figure.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many and what proportion of prison staff have completed suicide awareness training in each of the last three years.,All staff in contact with prisoners are required to receive training on suicide and self-harm prevention. We have recently revised the content of the training and we are now rolling out a new ÷Introduction to Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention course comprising six modules including mental health awareness training. The course is provided as part of the entry level training for new prison officers and as refresher training for existing staff. Since May 2017 over 1000 new prison officers have received the training and over 9000 existing staff (around 25%) have been trained in at least one of the six modules with just under 3000 (8%) completing all six modules. We have set Governors the challenging but achievable target of ensuring that all staff who have contact with prisoners complete all the modules by April 2019. Figures for the completion of the previous version of the training were not collected centrally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what his policy is on the use of the PAVA incapacitant spray in prisons.,PAVA spray is currently available to Her Majestys Prison and Probation Services (HMPPS) National Tactical Response Group (NTRG - specialist national resources) to use <em>tactically</em> during planned interventions to aid the restoration of order and control. In four prisons HMPPS have developed operational pilots to test the impact of issuing PAVA spay to general uniformed prison staff to use <em>reactively</em> when judged necessary. A methodology to test the impact of the introduction of PAVA has been developed. The current NTRG policy and the pilot operational guidance will inform any future policy.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether he has plans to review the prison maintenance contracts with GEOAmey and Carillion.,We are currently engaged in a joint review with providers and key stakeholders to consider what changes in the current FM contract arrangements are required to deliver an improved service to HMPPS. Detailed design solutions are being reviewed by a Steering Group composed of senior managers from the organisations involved with a view to implementing changes which should result in a more responsive reactive maintenance provision as well as improvements to the systems and processes required to manage the contracts effectively. In the interim we continue to manage and monitor performance closely through the current contractual processes.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 3 November 2017 to Question 109713 on staff: probation what the minimum level of staffing required by each community rehabilitation company is to meet its obligations of a sufficient level of staff.,The Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) contracts do not specify that CRCs must maintain staffing numbers at a particular level. However the contracts do contain robust provisions requiring each CRC to ensure that it employs a sufficient level of competent and appropriately trained staff. We continue to closely monitor this as part of our contract management and assurance process.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the adequacy of risk assessments for cell-sharing in prisons.,The Government is committed to keeping prisoners safe. The cell-sharing risk assessment process brings together all available information with the aim of identifying factors that increase the likelihood of harm by or to an offender so that decisions about locating prisoners in shared cells are made in a way that minimises those risks. We keep the process under review and continue to work to improve the information that is available to staff making these important decisions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate his Department has made of the number of people who lost their home after being recalled to prison in each quarter of the last five years.,The information requested is not collected centrally and could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost. Public protection is our priority. The power to recall is used to ensure that offenders on licence who present a high risk of harm to the public or are at risk of re-offending are returned to custody as quickly as possible. Probation services assess the risk an offender poses and recommend recall where they consider that necessary in all the circumstances. Officials in HM Prison and Probation Service headquarters will then ensure that the probation services have provided the evidence to support the recall before formally revoking the offenders licence. We are committed to ensuring that the power to recall is used effectively and appropriately and that offender managers identify alternatives to recall wherever possible. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 25 October 2017 to Question 108880 how many of the 10000 planned new prison places will be (a) additional places that increase the total number of prison places or (b) replacement places for older cells no longer deemed fit for use.,The Government set out its ambition for a reformed prison estate in the November 2016 Prison Safety and Reform White Paper. Our reforms will close down ageing and ineffective prisons and replace them with buildings fit for todays demands. Our new prison estate will create the physical conditions for Governors to achieve better educational training and rehabilitation outcomes. They will be built on a new for old basis.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent estimate he has made of the number of prison officers required to maintain safe staffing levels in prisons.,Every prison has an agreed safe decent and secure operating level (SDSOL) which reflects the category of prison and the types of prisoners held and supports the delivery of the regime in every prison. In addition this Government is on target to recruit an additional 2500 Prison Officers by December 2018 to improve safety and offender management in custody. Since April 2017 Governors have been empowered to manage workforce planning locally and use this flexibility to set their own staffing arrangements. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the Government's paper Deaths of offenders in the community published on 26 October 2017 if he will make an assessment of the implications for his policies of the incidents of deaths classified as self-inflicted of people under the supervision of community rehabilitation companies.,In 2016/17 there were 233 self-inflicted deaths of offenders in the community. This represents a decrease of 9% on the previous year. Probation services are now supporting an additional 40000 offenders each year after release from custody. Probation staff work hand-in-hand with other agencies Ò including local authorities and health services and in higher-risk cases the Police Ò to help ensure offenders with mental health or substance misuse issues have the right level of support. We have developed a joint protocol with the Department of Health setting out how probation health and treatment services should work together to provide treatment and support to offenders. We will be trialling the protocol in test-bed areas in England later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what is the average time taken to complete vetting processes for a prison officer recruit.,The average time for a new prison officer recruit to receive a full security check in 2017 is 46 calendar days. This is for new officer recruits who are recorded as starting work in a Prison (data up to the end of September 2017) who applied between the 1st January and 30th September 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will publish the risk assessment conducted prior to the part-privatisation of the probation service.,The Transforming Rehabilitation programme delivered fundamental reform of the probation system creating the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies and introducing supervision on licence to offenders serving custodial sentences of less than 12 months.It is standard practice during any significant government programme to assess the potential risks and to seek to mitigate them. The risk assessment conducted during Transforming Rehabilitation contains commercially sensitive information and cannot be published at this stage.

The power to recall is used to ensure that offenders on licence who present a high risk of harm to the public or are at risk of re-offending are returned to custody as quickly as possible. Probation services assess the risk an offender poses and recommend recall where they consider that necessary in all the circumstances. Officials in HM Prison and Probation Service headquarters will then ensure that the probation services have provided the evidence to support the recall before formally revoking the offenders licence. We are committed to ensuring that the power to recall is used effectively and appropriately and that offender managers identify alternatives to recall wherever possible. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people are managed by community rehabilitation companies in each constituency in England and Wales.,"Data on the number of offenders managed by each Community Rehabilitation Company is published each quarter and can be found at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/offender-management-statistics-quarterly\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/offender-management-statistics-quarterly</a>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what contingency plans his Department has put in place in the event that a community rehabilitation company terminates its contract; and if he will make a statement.,Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) contracts do not provide CRCs with an option to terminate the contract but do require Exit Plans to be in place and maintained throughout the life of the contracts.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what progress his Department has made towards achieving its target of employing 2500 extra prison officers by the end of 2018.,As part of the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper published in November 2016 the Government committed to an increase of 2500 prison officers by the end of 2018.Between the end of October 2016 and the end of August 2017 there has been a net increase of 1264 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Band 3 to 5 prison officers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Written Statement of 19 July 2017 HCWS81 on Justice Update which community rehabilitation companies have had their contracts amended.,All 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies have had their contracts amended so they can focus on activities that best rehabilitate offenders and keep society safe. This additional investment will see projected payments to providers being no higher than originally budgeted for at the time of the reforms.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of his Department's preparations for the UK leaving the EU with (a) an agreement on future partnership and (b) no agreement with the EU; and if he will make a statement.,Following the referendum in June 2016The MoJ continues to make rigorous preparations for a range of possible outcomes from the UK's negotiations with the EU.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the level of take-up by defendants of their right to be tried in a language they understand.,The Ministry has several statutory obligations to provide interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings for defendants. The Ministry is committed to ensuring the justice system is supported by a range of high quality language services that meet the needs of all those that require them.

Since that time the responsibility for these lines has been devolved to the ALBs and MOJ does not hold any information centrally in this regard.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans he has to support the UK legal services sector before and after the UK leaves the EU.,The UK is a world leader in the provision of legal services and English law has a reputation for excellence across the world. The reputation of the UKs Courts Judiciary and legal services sector will continue after we leave the EU and we will build on this to make the most of the opportunities of post-Brexit global Britain. We also continue to promote our excellent legal services overseas and launched our ÷Legal Services are GREAT campaign last month to highlight the UKs position as a premier legal centre.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans he has for training prison officers to receive improved training on mental health conditions.,The Government is committed to ensuring that prison officers receive the appropriate training to support prisoners with mental health needs. The Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) course delivered to new Prison Officers includes modules on mental health and personality disorders which emphasise the importance of mental health awareness. The revised ÏIntroduction to Suicide and Self-Harm (SASH) Prevention training includes a refreshed mental health awareness module. This training is being delivered to all new and existing Prison Officers and non-HMPPS staff who come into contact with prisoners. A Suicide Prevention Learning Tool has also been developed in partnership with Samaritans to support our suicide prevention and self-harm work. This tool communicates important messages to identify and support prisoners at risk. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 30 October 2017 to Question 109400 if he will publish the number of judicial office holders trained for personal independence payment tribunals in each quarter since 2 January 2013.,<table><tbody><table><tbody>All judicial training is the responsibility of senior judiciary and this is exercised through the Judicial College who have provided the following information. The First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Composition of Tribunals) Order 2008 and the Senior Presidents Practise Statement provides that all PIP appeals subject to limited exceptions must be heard by a judge and a medical and disability qualified members. All tribunal members in the Social Security and Child Support jurisdiction (with the exception of financially qualified Tribunal members) are trained to hear PIP appeals. The table below shows a combined number for both the judges and panel member training.

Every self-inflicted death in prison custody is independently investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) and is the subject of a coroners inquest. We take the findings of these investigations very seriously. Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service works with healthcare partners to ensure that action is taken to address the recommendations made by the PPO and any matters of concern brought to our attention by coroners including any that relate to the provision of medication or therapies for mental health conditions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 30 October 2017 to Question 109400 if he will publish the local personal independence payment areas and the relevant constituencies with a longer than average waiting time.,Her Majestys Courts and Tribunals Service currently only publishes waiting time information at national level. It can provide waiting time information at hearing centre and regional level but cannot provide the breakdown requested. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average rate has been for convicted prisoners escaping from custody per 1000 prisoners in each of the last five years.,"Statistics on the number of escapes from prison custody are published in the supplementary tables of the HMPPS Annual Digest which is available at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-national-offender-management-service-digest-2016-to-2017\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-national-offender-management-service-digest-2016-to-2017</a> Statistics are not collected in a way that distinguishes between convicted and unconvicted prisoners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the cost of training and maintaining Tornado teams has been for each year since 2010.,We do not hold the information requested because non-pay costs for Tornado training are included within a single yearly National Tactical Resource Group (NTRG) training budget. The associated expenditure reports only demonstrate the total cost of operating all training delivered by NTRG within the two training centres as a whole; all training expenditure is monitored under a single responsibility code. Additionally we are unable to determine the cost of maintaining Tornado teams as these costs are embedded within individual establishments budgets. The amount of budget allocated to tornado delivery differs widely based on the type of establishment required standing commitment and the number of staff requiring annual or initial training to fulfil their roles.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice on how many occasions Tornado teams have been deployed to prisons since September 2016.,Tornado teams are comprised of prison officers based in prison establishments who are trained to an advanced level of control and restraint. We have over 2000 trained staff across the country and they are grouped into Tornado teams made up of 12 officers and two commanders (a unit).Between 1/9/16 and 30/10/17 Ò Tornado teams have been deployed on a total of 30 occasions. In the majority of cases Tornado teams are deployed as a precaution and the resolution of the incident is provided by local staff.Tornado Teams can be deployed for a variety of incidents including Concerted Indiscipline Regime Support following an incident Assisting in searching and Incidents at Height.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent estimate his Department has made of the number of armed forces veterans under the supervision of Probation Service in England and Wales.,HMPPS does not collect or hold information on employees career history prior to joining the Civil Service. To enhance our recruitment and attraction of service leavers we have employed a HMPPS Armed Forces &amp; Reserve Liaison Co-ordinator to be the main point of contact working directly with the Career Transition Partnership and Service leavers. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the effect of the timescale to which the 2013 probation reforms were delivered on the outcomes of those reforms.,The Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) reforms introduced in 2013/14 were delivered to agreed timescales. In their report published in April 2016 the National Audit Office noted that ÷services have been sustained throughout a period of major change with users reporting that services had stayed the same or improved.We closely monitor the performance of both the NPS and CRCs to make sure services are protecting the public reducing reoffending and delivering the orders of the court. Her Majestys Inspectorate of Probation has found the work of the NPS to be good in many regions and recently praised Cumbria CRC for ÷prioritising public protection and their ÷quality of assessment and planning. Despite extending supervision to around 40000 additional released prisoners each year and introducing new services overall spend on the probation system has remained broadly stable.We recognise that probation needs to improve and aspects of service are falling short of our expectations. That is why we conducted an internal review of the probation system and as a result made changes to CRC contracts to reflect more accurately the fixed costs of delivering services to offenders. This will enable providers to focus on delivery of critical operational services although payments are still below original forecasts. We continue to keep the operation of the probation system under review and are exploring further improvements that could be made to the delivery of services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether community rehabilitation companies in England and Wales have received any additional funds in addition to the agreed contract price in 2016-17.,Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) received additional funding which totalled £37.15m in the 2016/17 financial year. These payments were made for a variety of reasons and cannot be broken down by CRC because the information is commercially sensitive. Furthermore agreements were made with CRCs on a case-by-case basis to enable them to re-invest contractual deductions in key areas of the business and improve services. We have made changes to how CRCs are paid for future years so they can focus on activities that best rehabilitate offenders and keep society safe. This additional investment will see projected payments to providers being no higher than originally budgeted for at the time of the reforms.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what lessons have been learnt from implementing the first contract for the delivery of probation services by community rehabilitation companies in England and Wales; and how those lessons inform his Department's approach to implementing the second contract in four years' time.,The Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) reforms introduced in 2013/14 were delivered to agreed timescales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the balance is of money held by prison authorities  on behalf of prisoners who have already been released from custody but are yet to receive that money.,The information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps the Government has taken to address the recommendations of the report on the Community Rehabilitation Company activity in Gloucestershire published by HM Inspectorate of Probation on 31 August 2017.,Public protection is our top priority and we will take all necessary action to make sure the probation system is reducing reoffending and preventing future victims.There is a contractual mechanism for dealing with recommendations made in HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and as a result we expect Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) to action all HMI Probation recommendations where reasonably practicable. Contract Management Teams give high priority to ensuring that these are followed through and ensure that the actions are successful in addressing the points raised.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his Department has different prison officer to prisoner ratio targets for different categories of prison; and if he will make a statement.,Every prison has an agreed safe decent and secure operating level (SDSOL) which reflects the category of prison and the types of prisoners held. The SDSOL is central to the delivery of the regime in every prison. In addition this Government is on target to recruit an additional 2500 Prison Officers by December 2018 to improve safety and offender management in custody. Since April 2017 Governors have been empowered to manage workforce planning locally and use this flexibility to set their own staffing arrangements.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what progress has been made on the roll-out of body-worn cameras for prison officers.,The roll out of Body Worn Video Cameras was completed in June 2017 and there are currently nearly 6000 in use across the estate. Body worn cameras will considerably aid safety in prisons acting as a visible deterrent against violence and assisting in prosecutions against those who commit crimes in jails.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the number of instances of drone use in smuggling in (a) 2016 and (b) 2017.,I refer the member to PQ 4436 answered on 17 July 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the (a) average and (b) longest time for a new recruit to receive a full security check and begin work in prison.,The average time for a new prison officer recruit to receive a full security check in 2017 is 46 calendar days. This is for new officer recruits who are recorded as starting work in a Prison (data up to the end of September 2017) who applied between the 1<sup>st</sup> January and 30<sup>th</sup> September 2017.The longest time for a new prison officer recruit to receive a full security check in 2017 is 141 calendar days. This is for new officer recruits who are recorded as starting work in a Prison (data up to the end of September 2017) who applied between the 1<sup>st</sup> January and 30<sup>th</sup> September 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether he plans to introduce a dementia strategy for older prisoners.,I recognise the challenges to prisons presented by the continuing rise in the number of older prisoners. My Department has established a working group to consider with our partners in health and social care how we can best meet the needs of this group including those who have needs related to dementia. Prison staff already have the benefit of operational guidance to assist them in identifying and caring for men and women in prison with dementia. We are working to enhance our knowledge about the health and social needs of older prisoners. Our work will include taking on expert advice and considering what changes we might need to make to the prison estate or to the regimes within prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice will reference to his Department's press release Increased security measures to give prison officers right tools for job published on 22 October 2017 how many police-style handcuffs and restraints will be provided to prison officers.,We are determined to ensure the safety of our staff in our prisons. We are therefore issuing the rigid bar handcuffs to all front line staff who currently carry a baton. As part of the roll out staff will be required to be trained in the use of the handcuffs which will be carried out during their annual control and restraint refresher training. We have begun the procurement of the new handcuffs and will deliver these alongside the necessary training to all frontline staff as quickly as practicable.We are fully committed to addressing violence and assaults by increasing staffing levels and improving prisoner-staff relationships. We are making swift progress in strengthening the frontline with 20003 individual prison officers in post at the end of August Ò an increase of 1290 since October 2016. Alongside this we are moving to a new key worker model which will mean every residential prison officer supporting a caseload of around 6 prisoners. This will mean prisoners have a consistent named officer to challenge and support them away from violence and reoffending.We have also invested in 5600 body-worn cameras across the prison estate rolled out alongside training in staff interaction with prisoners to support better relationships and give high-quality evidence to support prosecutions where assaults do take place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what his policy is on the replacement of Victorian prisons with new-build prisons.,We have committed to transforming our prison estate by investing £1.3bn to deliver up to 10000 new places.This includes pushing ahead with plans to close or redevelop older prisons and open new accommodation in this parliament.This will help deliver prisons that are more safe and secure so our staff can work more closely with offenders to change their lives and turn their back on crime for good.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if his Department will publish the findings of recent trials of body cameras for prison officers.,The pilot was comprehensively evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures of impact. The evaluation of the pilot is still being completed and a formal report prepared. Once that has been done it has always been the intention to make this available. We will publish the report in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the cost to the public purse of the forthcoming increases in annual salaries of (a) bands three to five prison officers (b) all staff who work in public prisons and (c) all employees of HM Prison and Probation Service.,Figures shared with HM Treasury estimated that the 2017/18 pay award for (a) bands three to five prison officers to be £17.8m. This figure also includes the estimated pay award for band 2 operational prison staff commonly referred to as Operational Service Grades or OSGs. If you include the estimated pay award for operational managers (bands seven to eleven) this increases the overall cost for operational staff covered by the remit of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) to £19.1m When reporting quarterly workforce data HMPPS reports non-operational staff in one group and does not break down the number working in roles based in either our Headquarters (HQ) or prisons. It is therefore difficult to provide an estimate on the costs of all HMPPS staff working in prisons alone as we dont disaggregate them from those staff working in HQ. The estimated pay award for all non-operational staff not covered by the remit of the PSPRB and working across the estate including prisons is £9.8m. The estimated pay award for all employees of HM Prison and Probation Service including those working in the National Probation Service (NPS) which was estimated at £3.8m is £32.7m.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners are serving sentences for imprisonment for public protection in each prison; and how many have already served their minimum tariff for the most recent period for which information is available.,Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is focused on giving IPP prisoners the support opportunities and motivation they need to progress more quickly so that once they have completed their tariff and are reviewed by the Parole Board they have the best possible prospects for securing release.Unto that end and as part of a joint action plan with the Parole Board HMPPS has implemented measures such as individual psychology-led central case reviews and increased access to specific offending behaviour programmes. Additionally and building upon the success of the Progression Regime at HMP Warren Hill HMPPS is planning for three new Progression Regimes to be opened by the end of March 2018.These initiatives are working. During 2016/17 46% of all IPP prisoners considered by the Parole Board were released and 24% recommended for a move to open conditions. 576 IPP prisoners were released in 2016 more than ever before. 315 IPP prisoners have already been released in the first half of 2017.The attached table shows how many unreleased prisoners serving indeterminate sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) are located in each establishment and how many have served their minimum tariff. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of community service sentences were carried out in the local authority where the offence was committed in each of the last three years.,The information requested is not collated centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate the Government has made of the proportion of prisoners who spend more than 22 hours per day in their cell.,The information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The Government is fully committed to making our prisons safe so that they can provide the maximum time out of cell for meaningful and purposeful activity to give prisoners the training skills and work experience needed on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many offenders the Government projected would be referred to each community rehabilitation company in each quarter at the time of signing contracts with those companies.,"Early indicative estimates of the volumes of offenders starting with Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) annually were published as part of the ÷Transforming Rehabilitation: A Strategy for Reform consultation document which can be found at: <a href=\https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation/results/transforming-rehabilitation-response.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation/results/transforming-rehabilitation-response.pdf</a>. It was always anticipated that volumes would vary through the life of the contract and we did not guarantee caseload levels to the providers. Since 2014 there have been changes in the case-mix of offenders and falls in the number of community orders. This has led to a proportionately lower number of cases being allocated to CRCs. To respond to these changes in volume we changed the way we pay CRCs to reflect more accurately the costs of delivering services to offenders. This ensures they can focus on the delivery of those vital services."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average number of hours was that prisoners spent on purposeful activity in each day in (a) England and Wales and (b) each prison in England and Wales in the latest period for which figures are available.,We do not currently collate information centrally for the average number of hours prisoners spend on daily purposeful activity and it could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. We want prisons to be places of hard work and high ambition with incentives for prisoners to learn. We have empowered Governors so they have more freedom to innovate and make the best decisions for their prisons. By next year every governor will be able to tailor education and training to the needs of their prisoners providing offenders the right support and challenge to help turn their backs on crime.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of offenders are managed by the National Probation Services; and what proportion of offenders the Government estimated would be so managed at the time of that body's creation.,"Early indicative estimates of the volumes of offenders starting with Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) and the National Probation Service (NPS) annually were published as part of the ÷Transforming Rehabilitation: A Strategy for Reform consultation document which can be found at: <a href=\https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation/results/transforming-rehabilitation-response.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation/results/transforming-rehabilitation-response.pdf</a>.

Workforce figures as at 30 September are due to be published in November. Figures for the Community Rehabilitation Companies following their move to the private sector are not collected by the Ministry of Justice but contracts with CRCs require each CRC to ensure that it employs a sufficient level of staff and that its workforce is competent and adequately trained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners serving imprisonment for public protection sentences there are in each prison; and how many such prisoners have already served their minimum tariff.,Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is focused on giving IPP prisoners the support opportunities and motivation they need to progress more quickly so that once they have completed their tariff and are reviewed by the Parole Board they have the best possible prospects for securing release.Unto that end and as part of a joint action plan with the Parole Board HMPPS has implemented measures such as individual psychology-led central case reviews and increased access to specific offending behaviour programmes. Additionally and building upon the success of the Progression Regime at HMP Warren Hill HMPPS is planning for three new Progression Regimes to be opened by the end of March 2018.These initiatives are working. During 2016/17 46% of all IPP prisoners considered by the Parole Board were released and 24% recommended for a move to open conditions. 576 IPP prisoners were released in 2016 more than ever before. 315 IPP prisoners have already been released in the first half of 2017.The attached table shows how many unreleased prisoners serving indeterminate sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) are located in each establishment and how many have served their minimum tariff. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of probation assessments carried out by each community rehabilitation company were administered (a) by telephone and (b) face-to-face in the latest period for which figures are available.,The information requested is not collated centrally. Some Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) currently use telephone reporting as just one part of their operating models in addition to regular reporting in person where it is an appropriate tool for the individual case. Contract management teams continue to closely monitor and robustly manage providers to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to reduce reoffending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer. We have fundamentally reformed probation so that for the first time ever all offenders given a custodial sentence receive probation support. We remain in discussion with CRCs ensure our ambitious reforms are delivered successfully.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to tackle (a) violence (b) drug use (c) use of drones and (d) use of mobile phones in prison.,The level of violence in our prisons is too high. Illicit trade in items such as mobile phones and drugs Ò facilitated by supply routes such as drones Ò is a significant driver of the increase in assaults on staff and other prisoners. We are fully committed to addressing the increase in violence and assaults by increasing staffing levels and improving prisoner-staff relationships. We are making swift progress in strengthening the frontline with 20003 individual prison officers in post at the end of August Ò an increase of 1290 since October 2016. Alongside this we are moving to a new key worker model which will mean every residential prison officer supporting a caseload of around 6 prisoners. This will mean prisoners have a consistent named officer to challenge and support them away from violence and reoffending. We have invested in 5600 body-worn cameras across the prison estate rolled out alongside training in staff interaction with prisoners to support better relationships and give high-quality evidence to support prosecutions where assaults do take place. We are likewise determined to tackle the illegal flow of drugs and mobile phones into our prisons. Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has established national and regional intelligence units which are working with law enforcement partners to develop intelligence on offenders who are involved in the illicit economy so that we can carry out operations to find and disrupt criminal activity in prisons. We are building on this by investing £3 million to create an HMPPS Serious Organised Crime Unit which will work closely with the Home Office and police forces to further disrupt organised crime in prisons. We are the first jurisdiction in the world to develop tests for psychoactive substances in prisons and are using these and over 300 trained sniffer dogs in order to detect those using and supplying them. Anyone found with contraband will be subject to disciplinary action and police investigation. We have invested £2 million to equip every prison in England and Wales with technology to strengthen searching and security including portable detection poles which can be deployed at fixed points such as reception and extra portable signal detectors to use on the wings to support searches. We are working with mobile network operators to deliver ground-breaking technology which will stop mobiles smuggled into prisons from working. We are also bearing down on the supply routes through which illicit items enter prisons. To date there have been over 40 arrests and 15 convictions of criminals involved in drone activity Ò resulting in those convicted being sentenced to a total of more than 40 years in jail. In April 2017 we set up a specialist team of prison and police officers to improve our efforts to intercept and capture drones and bring the criminals involved to justice. We are working closely with government partners on the UKs response to the drone threat and the development of counter drone technology. This is keeping us at the forefront of the work being progressed nationally and internationally to stop criminal use of drones.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department has taken to help mothers leaving prison rebuild family relationships.,Families can play a significant role in supporting an offender and positive family relationships are an important factor in reducing reoffending. We have given prison governors the budget and flexibility to spend their resources as they see fit to help prisoners establish or maintain important family and significant other ties. A new contract for family services across the female estate was awarded in early October 2017. This will allow womens prisons to work closely with a single professional family services provider to develop innovative services including those to support mothers in preparing for their release. We are also enabling better communication between families and facilitating organised and constructive family days alongside courses and programmes to promote parenting and family engagement.

Offenders on licence are subject to strict licence conditions and supervision. Anyone who is suspected of committing a further crime while on licence can be arrested and charged and if convicted given a further sentence. If the offence is serious they can be remanded in custody until trial.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department plans to take to address the problems identified in HM Inspectorate of Probation's report on Gloucestershire with service delivery  carried out by working links.,There is a contractual mechanism for dealing with recommendations made in HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and as a result Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) are required to prepare action plans to address the issues raised. Contract Management Teams give high priority to ensuring that those plans are followed through and ensure that those actions are successful in addressing the points raised. Public protection is our top priority and we will take all necessary action to make sure the probation system is reducing reoffending and preventing future victims. We have fundamentally reformed probation so that for the first time ever all offenders given a custodial sentence receive probation support on release. We continue to work with the CRCs to ensure they deliver services that have the correct levels of supervision and support for offenders.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many probation staff have been affected by the administrative error by Shared Services on pension contributions; and whether he plans to compensate staff affected by that error.,There have been 2336 National Probation Staff who have been affected by the recent problems relating to pensions contributions. There are currently no plans to compensate these staff. There is a regular governance structure in relation to the provision of Shared Services which reviews the service delivery of our provider Shared Services Connected Limited to the Department. These mechanisms regularly review issues and incidents and have fully managed the recent issues in relation to pension contributions. These mechanisms have been effective in the management and closure of the defects. Following the migration of the departments HR and payroll data to the new cross government Single Operating Platform a small number of defects have been identified and corrected. These led to the under-collection of pension contributions for some staff. These have been corrected with the final correction being applied for inclusion in this months payroll and the full contributions have been paid to the pension scheme administrator. The contribution under collection only affected 4 types of overtime rate and 2 absence scheme calculations with the remaining payroll elements all being subject to the correct pensions deduction. The departments migration to the Single Operating Platform was subject to formal programme control and governance and these programme mechanisms have been used to resolve these issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans his Department has to create a task force to ensure HM Inspectorate Probation recommendations are implemented across the National Probation Service and 21 community rehabilitation companies.,We take recommendations from Her Majestys Inspectorate of Probation (HMI Probation) very seriously. A dedicated unit was set up in Her Majestys Prisons and Probation Service (HMPPS) in the Summer of 2017 to coordinate implementation across the Department of all recommendations made by Inspectorates and other bodies in relation to offender services. This unit works with both the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies to ensure that changes are implemented and progress monitored.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of recent HM Inspectorate of Probation reports which indicate that workloads in both the National Probation Service and community rehabilitation companies are dangerously high.,The great majority of Quality &amp; Impact Reports by Her Majestys Inspectorate of Probation have commented favourably on the performance of the National Probation Service (NPS). We recognise that staff shortages in certain parts of the country have resulted in high caseloads in those areas. The NPS is addressing this via a major recruitment campaign and is on target to recruit around 500 additional trainee probation officers and over 1000 probation service officers in 2017-18. Contracts with Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) require each that each CRC ensures that it employs a sufficient level of staff and that its workforce is competent and adequately trained. We closely monitor and robustly manage providers to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to reduce reoffending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much additional funding he plans for each community rehabilitation company to receive in 2017.,Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) received additional funding which totalled £37.15m in the 2016/17 financial year. CRCs also received an interim uplift which totalled £22m in the early months of the 2017/18 financial year. These payments were made for a variety of reasons and cannot be broken down by CRC because the information is commercially sensitive. Furthermore agreements were made with CRCs on a case-by-case basis to enable them to re-invest contractual payment deductions in key areas of the business and improve services. We have made changes to how CRCs are paid for future years so they can focus on activities that best rehabilitate offenders and keep society safe. This additional investment will see projected payments to providers being no higher than originally budgeted for at the time of the reforms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what meetings (a) he and (b) his predecessor has had with community rehabilitation companies in (i) 2016 and (ii) 2017 to date.,Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) are closely monitored through a robust contract management and assurance process which I and the Secretary of State for Justice are regularly sighted on.The Secretary of State for Justice met with CRC staff as part of his visit to Camden and Islington probation services in London in July 2017. We continue to work with CRCs to ensure they deliver services which reduce re-offending protect the public and help offenders contribute to society.The previous Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss met with CRC staff as part of her visit to Lambeth probation services in February 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to enhance joint-working between probation services and sentencers.,Successful joint working between the probation service and judges magistrates and other key partners is vital to ensure that we not only keep people safe by ensuring offenders receive the most appropriate sentence but help offenders turn away from a life of crime by ensuring they have the correct levels of supervision and support. The National Sentencer and Probation Forum has the primary aim of encouraging and facilitating engagement between sentencers providers of probation services and officials from the Ministry of Justice and Her Majestys Prisons and Probation Service to discuss issues and trends which are relevant to sentencing and the provision of probation services at both a local and a national level. There are also a number of communication channels and existing forums to encourage effective joint working between probation service providers and sentencers at a local level. We continue to keep the effectiveness of these arrangements under review as part of our ongoing work to improve probation services.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to ensure the continuing professional development of existing prison officers.,Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) already have a wide range of learning resources including face to face courses in specialist areas such as Offender Management Safer Custody Use of Force Hostage Negotiator and Intelligence. The content of all HMPPS learning programmes is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect policy and legislative changes and the changing needs of the organisation. HMPPS are also planning to launch a new interactive learning catalogue this year which will help our workforce to better understand the learning offer and make greater use of continuous learning so they have the tools and capabilities to support offenders in the modern prison environment.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to improve the training of new prison officers.,Initial training of newly recruited prison officers begins with a 12-week Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) course. This provides new officers with a foundation level of training in all core skill areas including interpersonal skills mental health awareness equality violence reduction and safer custody alongside the more traditional security awareness and practical skills needed to be a prison officer. HMPPS has also invested in training for 75 Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) Mentors who support new entrant staff in the first 12 months of their role in establishments. HMPPS are currently reviewing how the POELT training package can be delivered differently to our new prison officer recruits so that they are more confident and have an improved introduction for working in a modern prison environment.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether he plans to extend statutory status to the office of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.,We remain committed to continuing to reform our prison framework to make prisons places of safety and reform. Although neither measure was included in the Queens Speech our priorities can be delivered without legislation. The statutory purpose for prisons set out what the prison system should seek to achieve. This remains what the whole system is working towards: protecting the public; reforming and rehabilitating offenders; preparing prisoners for life outside prison; and maintaining an environment that is safe and secure. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman works to a comprehensive set of Terms of Reference which were updated in April of this year and will be kept under review. To further strengthen the role of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman we are developing a Protocol between the Ombudsman and Ministry of Justice to set out the role of both organisations in relation to each other similar to the protocol agreed between HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Department earlier this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his Department's budget is sufficient to fund the 1.7 per cent pay rise for prison officers without decreasing spending on other departmental responsibilities.,When the Government published its response to the sixteenth Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) report in September the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (CST) set out that the pay award for prison officers will be funded from within existing budgets.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much his Department has allocated to improve prison buildings in England and Wales.,The Ministry of Justice resource and capital budget for major (centrally funded) investment in existing prison buildings for 2017/18 is £93.7m. The Government stated its ambition for the prison estate transformation programme in the November 2016 Prison Safety and Reform White Paper which set out that we want a prison estate that is less crowded better organised and that is increasingly made up of modern fit for purpose accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to ensure that it achieves value for money when it sells former prison sites.,We always seek to achieve value for money for the taxpayer. We have therefore engaged professional advisors to inform us on the future development and potential of ageing and ineffective prisons. This forms part of our consideration of the future of the estate. However no decisions have been made about prison sites other than those already announced.Valuation information of any kind in relation to the Ministry of Justice estate is deemed commercially sensitive and therefore would not be released.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment his Department has made of the effectiveness of prison-based de-radicalisation programmes; and what improvements have been made to such programmes in the last 12 months.,HMPPS delivers a number of interventions to promote desistance and dis-engagement from extremism. These interventions include psychological and theological approaches. The effectiveness of these and other measures to combat extremism continues to be kept under review. New programmes and approaches to de-radicalisation are developed where necessary in order to ensure our response remains commensurate with the threat posed and the rehabilitative needs of the cohort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he has taken to use contracts it has with G4S to improve the tagging performance of that company; and if he will make a statement.,G4S provide electronic monitoring hardware (tags and home monitoring units) under contract to the Ministry of Justice having ceased delivery of field services and monitoring operations in early 2014 when the contract was transferred to Capita. On 27 June 2017 G4S were awarded preferred bidder status for the next generation electronic monitoring hardware contract with Capita continuing to provide the field services and monitoring operations. The contracts are subject to stringent specifications and the equipment has been rigorously tested to exacting performance standards. The Department has robust processes in place to monitor and manage contractors and will not hesitate to take action when standards fall short.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 11 September 2017 to Question 9980 on iron and steel: procurement what progress his Department has made on delivering greater UK steel content in line with the public procurement guidelines published by the Government in April 2016.,Approximately 2500 tonnes of structural steel has been used in the construction of HMP Berwyn. 100% of this steel has been sourced from British suppliers and manufacturers. Our procurement activities will follow Government guidance to ensure we take full account of the value provided by UK steel producers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his Department maintains a list of books and other written materials which have been banned by each prison.,HM Prison and Probation Services (HMPPS) Public Protection Manual (Prison Service Instruction 18/2016) explains which materials are seen as inappropriate for prisoners to have in their possession.The Manual contains a list of publications that are restricted for public protection purposes. This list of materials is not exhaustive given the ongoing process of identification assessment and removal of inappropriate materials. For all publications not on the banned list prison staff are required to consider the content against the criteria in the Manual. Governors of all prisons in England and Wales can restrict publications at their own discretion for good order and discipline security and public protection purposes. Some prisons have developed an enhanced list of restricted publications since the Manual was published. Any decision to restrict material that is not listed in the Manual is made on a case-by-case basis by all prisons. HMPPS does not hold copies of any enhanced lists or records of individual governors decisions.Materials including books may be restricted in prisons. This can happen in three ways: <ul>the Public Protection Manual contains a list of materials to which no prisoner in any prison is allowed access;the Manual also allows an individual prison to add to that list for the whole population of the prison if local circumstances require it; andmaterials not otherwise restricted may need to be withheld from individual prisoners if required by their offending behaviour or risk management needs.</ul> We have put in place a system which as part of the Incentives and Earned Privileges Policy (Prison Service Instruction 30/2013) enables books to be sent in by family and friends either directly or via an approved retailer either online or in high street shops. Prisoners also have access to public library services. In addition as set out in Prisoner Retail Policy (Prison Service Instruction 23/2013) prisons also have the discretion to allow purchases to be made from catalogues but it is at individual prison discretion if this service is offered at all and if so which catalogues are used. There are currently no set timelines for when items must reach the intended prisoner as security checks must be made before a book is handed over to the prisoner although the expectation would be as soon as it is practically possible. The screening of incoming goods including books is necessary to combat illicit commodities being smuggled into prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what guidance his Department has provided to prison governors on rules permitting books to be handed on to prisoners.,HM Prison and Probation Services (HMPPS) Public Protection Manual (Prison Service Instruction 18/2016) explains which materials are seen as inappropriate for prisoners to have in their possession.The Manual contains a list of publications that are restricted for public protection purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to ensure that drug users receive (a) suitable accommodation and (b) access to addiction support services after they leave prison.,Assisting offenders to secure suitable accommodation upon their release is a vital part of the Governments approach to reducing reoffending and is especially important for those who struggle with substance misuse. Through the commencement of the Homelessness Reduction Act (2017) Prisons and Probation providers will be subject to the new duty to refer to the local housing authority someone who might be at risk of becoming homeless including drug users. Additionally as part of our prison reforms a shared accommodation performance measure for Prison Governors and Probation Providers is being considered to incentivise collaboration and increase the likelihood of offenders securing suitable accommodation. We are also exploring with our health partners what more we can do to give probation the tools they need to enable effective substance misuse treatment upon release. This will be supported by work to improve systems for sending health information to community-based providers in order to support continued treatment through the gate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will give the Parole Board the authority to decide when a hearing can be held to consider the cases of those with imprisonment for public protection sentences who are still in prison.,The Secretary of State sets by delegated authority to officials the next review date of prisoners serving the IPP sentence and who have completed their tariff. He does so with regard to the work (including but not only courses) which the prisoner needs to complete in order to reduce his risk and so present the Parole Board with evidence to support release.IPP offenders are entitled to be considered for release at least every two years or less once their tariff has expired. The Secretary of State may set a short review date where the prisoner has completed risk reduction work and so has the evidence which the Parole Board needs to direct his release.We have been working closely with the Parole Board to process these cases as quickly as possible and earlier this year we set up a new unit focused on this and improving the efficiency of the parole process.This work is continuing to achieve results with 576 IPP releases in 2016; the highest number of annual releases since the sentence became available in 2005.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice for what reason the recommendation from Abigail Rogers at the Public Protection Casework Section of the Parole Board in her letter dated 19 May 2017 that a prisoner be transferred to an open conditions prison has not yet been acted upon.,If the Hon member writes with further details I will look into the case for him.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many (a) staff and (b) vacancies there were in each community rehabilitation company in each quarter since those companies were established.,Ownership of Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) transferred to new providers in 2015. Contracts with CRCs require each CRC to ensure that it employs a sufficient level of staff and that its workforce is competent and adequately trained. We no longer routinely collect and publish CRC workforce numbers.We closely monitor and robustly manage providers to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to reduce reoffending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the prison incarceration rates per capita are for (a) England and Wales and (b) other EU countries; and what the average cost of jailing a person per year is in (i) England and Wales and (ii) other EU countries.,"The SPACE I report (last published in April 2017) covers incarceration rates for each member country of the Council of Europe: <a href=\http://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2017/04/SPACE_I_2015_FinalReport_161215_REV170425.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2017/04/SPACE_I_2015_FinalReport_161215_REV170425.pdf</a> Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) routinely publishes average costs per prisoner and prison place and overall prison unit costs of individual prisons for each private and public sector prison in England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will place the documents relating to the contract signed in 2017 between the Government and G4S for the electronic tagging of offenders in the Library.,A redacted version of the new contract between the Ministry of Justice and G4S for electronic monitoring hardware equipment will be published on Contracts Finder in line with current transparency regulations. We are currently planning to sign the contract by the end of October 2017. I will write to the Honourable gentleman when the contract has been published.The field monitoring services including fitting and removal of tags and the monitoring provision is provided by Capita Business Services Limited.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of offenders who re-offended or breached their licence and who were liable to be recalled were not recalled in each of the last three years.,We do not hold the information requested centrally and it could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to implement the recommendations of the report by Lord Farmer The importance of strengthening prisoners' family ties to prevent reoffending and reduce intergenerational crime published in August 2017.,Families can play a significant role in supporting an offender; positive family relationships have been identified as a protective factor in the desistance from crime. The Government welcomes the recommendations identified by Lord Farmer to strengthen family ties to help offenders turn their lives around and protect public safety.<br>Work has already commenced on developing a strategy which will take forward recommendations from the review. We are already taking forward some key recommendations including giving governors the budget and flexibility to spend their resources appropriately to help prisoners keep important family ties.<br>Alongside this we plan to pilot new family and significant relationship performance measures which will provide crucial guidance to deliver more consistent services in areas such as visitations across the entire prisons estate.<br>We will continue to hold regular meetings with Lord Farmer to update him on implementation of his recommendations.<br>The Government will ensure that Parliament is fully appraised of progress on implementation and will set out its proposals for doing so in a letter to the Chair of the Justice Select Committee in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department has taken to increase the levels of literacy and numeracy in the prison population.,All adult prisoners in English prisons have an assessment of their maths and English needs on entry to prison when they transfer between prisons and prior to release. As set out in the White Paper ÏPrison Safety and Reform published in November 2016 we will ensure that a core common curriculum focused on the underpinning basic skills of maths and English will apply in every prison and that every prisoner will have a Personal Learning Plan linked to their sentence plan. We have introduced additional assessment of prisoners levels of maths and English on transfer between prisons and on release gathering data that will allow us to compare prisoners attainment in maths and English on release with that at the start of custody and to measure progress made by prisoners whilst serving their sentences. We have already introduced significant flexibility in our funding rules for prison education giving prison governors more ability to put in place a curriculum that meets the needs of learners and responds to the demand for skills in the areas to which those prisoners will be released. Once existing prison education contracts end we will make prison governors fully responsible for education provision in their prisons commissioning the services they think are most appropriate in their individual prison. This will allow governors to decide how to structure their educational regime and who delivers it while following a core common curriculum set nationally which will focus on maths and English.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department has taken to reduce the incidence of self-harming of people held in the Prison Estate.,We have put in place a range of measures to support prisoners who are at risk of self-harm or suicide especially in the early period in custody when they are at their most vulnerable.We have established a Prison Safety programme to support establishments in the implementation of the reforms set out in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper including our investment in an additional 2500 staff who will help deliver consistent purposeful regimes and allow us to introduce a new key worker role to support better staff-prisoner relationships.We are rolling out new training across the estate to support our staff to identify the risks and triggers of suicide and self-harm and understand what they can do to support prisoners at risk. We have put in place specialist roles - regional safer custody teams - in every region to provide advice to prisons and to spread good practice on identifying and supporting prisoners at risk. We are using experts including providing extra funding for the Samaritans to provide targeted support for prison staff and to prisoners directly.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department has taken to promote identify and treat mental health conditions in the prison population.,The department remains committed to reforming our prisons to make them safe and secure establishments with access to health including mental health services to support the rehabilitation of offenders in custody.Health services in English prisons are commissioned by NHS England and by Local Health Boards in Wales informed by evidence of the need in each prison. All prisoners have an initial health screen at reception by clinical staff and may be referred for further treatment within or outside prisons where mental health needs are identified.Prison staff also have a critical role to play in identifying mental health needs and supporting prisoners. We are rolling out new suicide and self-harm prevention training which includes a module on mental health awareness. This is being delivered to all new prison officers as part of their entry level training (POELT) to existing prison officers and to non-HMPPS staff who come into contact with prisoners.Alongside this we are investing £100 million towards recruitment of 2500 new staff and introducing new offender management arrangements in prisons under which Key Workers will have particular responsibility for a small number of prisoners. These measures will enhance the time and resources available to support prisoners. Dedicated officers will be able to build a relationship with prisoners and be in a better position to recognise and respond to changes in their behaviour or their mental well-being.We are continuing to work with our health partners to improve our understanding of the mental health of prisoners. Since April 2017 we have launched co-commissioning which means governors will now begin to have greater input into decision making about health provision in their prisons enabling them to identify and work with health commissioners to contribute to the commissioning of quality healthcare services.<p />
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will introduce legislative proposals to cancel or bar overseas travel by convicted paedophiles from the UK.,Follwoing release from prison into the community on licence all child sex offenders will be subject to a series of licence conditions. This will include as standard the requirement to Ïnot travel outside the United Kingdom the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man except with the prior permission of your supervising officer or for the purposes of immigration deportation or removal. Such permission is granted only in the most exceptional circumstances where the offender meets a strict set of criteria. In addition to the prohibitions in a licence in England and Wales the Police may also apply to the courts for a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) to prevent a sex offender from travelling overseas where they suspect that the offender could commit an offence while outside of the UK. This SHPO replaced the Foreign Travel Order introduced by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which remains in operation in Northern Ireland.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many foreign prisoners have been (a) deported and (b) transferred to foreign prisons in 2017.,The Government is absolutely committed to removing Foreign National Offenders from the United Kingdom. 6343 FNOs were removed in 2016/17 Ò a record number. Of these 110 prisoners were transferred to prisons in their own countries in the same period.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many foreign nationals are in prison in the UK; and what steps his Department is taking to send those nationals back to their countries of origin.,As of 30 June 2017 there were 6792 foreign national offenders serving a custodial sentence in England and Wales. This Government is absolutely committed to removing Foreign National Offenders and during the financial year 2016 / 2017 6343 FNOs were removed from prisons immigration removal centres and the community. The barriers to returning FNOs to their countries of nationality are varied and complex which is why the action we take must be tailored to each specific country. I am working closely with ministerial colleagues in DFID FCO and Home Office to ensure that all options are being pursued and that our early removal mechanisms are working as effectively as possible. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many reports of (a) anti-Semitism (b) Islamophobia (c) racism and (d) homophobia by prisoners have been received in the last two years.,The information requested is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what occupational training is available for prisoners; what the criteria are for subscribing to such training; and to what degree any training is oversubscribed.,There is a wide range of occupational training available to prisoners. The prison governor works with their education provider to put in place education and training based on the needs of learners in the establishment and the skills in demand by employers in the areas to which prisoners will be released.Prisoners are allocated to relevant education and training based on an assessment of their learning needs and in response to information advice and guidance by a National Careers Service adviser. Allocation to education and training takes account of career aspirations as well as sentence plans to ensure that interventions are appropriately prioritised and sequenced with other rehabilitation activities. Individual prisons may also apply their own local criteria.We do not collect data centrally on the number of courses that are oversubscribed.As set out in the White Paper ÏPrison Safety and Reform published in November 2016 we are empowering prison governors to decide how their establishments learning offer is arranged what curriculum is put in place and who delivers the education and training.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether there is a national curriculum for prison education.,There is currently no national education curriculum for prison education but work is in hand to introduce a core common curriculum across the prison estate focusing on maths and English and using the same awarding bodies for particular types of provision so those starting a course at one prison can bank and build on their progress if they move elsewhere. The curriculum for each prison in England is agreed locally by the prison governor with their Offender Learning and Skills Service provider drawing from a range of provision that the provider is required to offer.In October 2016 we introduced changes to the prison education funding rules to give prison governors more authority to put in place education that meets the needs of prisoners in their establishment. Education Delivery Plans for the academic year that commenced on 1 August 2017 are wholly based on those new funding rules and flexibilities enabling governors to commission delivery of training that meets more effectively the needs of employers in the areas to which prisoners will be released. As set out in the White Paper ÏPrison Safety and Reform published in November 2016 we are extending governor control still further. <br>Prison governors will be fully responsible for education provision in their prisons once existing contracts end commissioning the services they think are most appropriate in their individual prison.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much has been spent on education services in prisons over the last two years.,The spend on offender learning in England was £145.2m in the 2015-16 financial year and £146.7m in 2016-17. These figures exclude a number of private prisons where the operator is responsible for providing education under their contract with Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service.As we announced in last Novembers White Paper we will devolve responsibility for prison education budgets to governors empowering them to decide how education is organised what curriculum is delivered and who provides the education.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether people convicted for hate crimes receive anti-racist or other relevant education as part of their rehabilitation.,I refer the Honourable Member to my answers to her on 14<sup>th</sup> July (PQ 3463 and PQ 3452).
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department has taken to ensure that all prisoners are able to open a bank account.,HMPPS coordinates the Offender Banking Programme in England and Wales which runs in partnership with 6 major UK commercial banks and a leading Building Society in order to give offenders who are soon to be released from custody the opportunity to apply for a basic bank account. Having access to a bank account is vital for access to benefits and to receive pay from employment on release a key element in helping with the rehabilitation of offenders.There are currently 101 prison-bank partnerships the most recent partnership being made with HMP Berwyn a large new public sector prison which opened earlier this year. Every resettlement prison has a relationship with a specific bank who offer direct support and guidance on their specific processes to prison staff to enable the opening of accounts.On arrival in to custody staff complete a Basic Custody Screening Tool and information from this indicates that 71% of prisoners have bank accounts. HMPPS does not keep a record of those who have left prison without a bank account. However around 5000 accounts per year are opened under the programme. The banks report a high percentage of those accounts subsequently being activated and used on release.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what support is provided to prisoners who have an addiction to new psychoactive substances.,The Ministry of Justice and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) takes seriously the ongoing challenges that substance misuse including psychoactive substances (PS) pose to our establishments and we continue to implement a range of measures to address both the availability and use of such harmful substances. This is based on a multi-agency approach working closely with health partners and law enforcement agencies.We welcome the work that the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) has done to draw further attention to the role that psychoactive substances have played in a number of deaths in prison custody and the lessons from his investigations into these cases are informing our programme of work to prevent self-inflicted deaths in custody and to improve safety in prisons more generally.We have not made an assessment of the impact of PS on reoffending but know that that substance misuse more widely is associated with higher rates of reoffending.Figures drawn from the HMPPS Incident Reporting System suggest there were just over 4000 incidents where psychoactive substances were found in prisons between August 2016 and July 2017 in England and Wales. Prisons have at their disposal a range of security measures to reduce the supply of drugs into prisons including physical searching the use of x-ray machines CCTV surveillance cameras intelligence-led searches as well as drug detection dogs. HMPPS have trained more than 300 dogs to detect PS and these dogs are available to all prisons. HMPPS are also exploring additional innovative security measures and new technology to complement existing searching methods in prisons.The introduction of mandatory drug testing for psychoactive substances in prisons in September 2016 was also a significant step to support our prisons in tackling the supply and use of these lethal drugs. We are not aware of any other prison service in the world that has introduced these innovative new tests.There were 27277 random mandatory drug tests administered between October 2016 and March 2017. Each sample taken is tested for a range of illicit drugs including psychoactive substances. As these are random drugs tests prisoners tested in a single month are unique but an individual prisoner could be chosen in multiple months. Figures for 2017/18 will be published in the Annual HMPPS Digest in July 2018.We routinely and regularly conduct research to determine the range of substances in prisons to ensure that we are testing for the substances that are most commonly used.Drug treatment also plays an important role in tackling PS in prisons. Substance misuse services in England are commissioned through NHS England to provide a range of services to support recovery and rehabilitation. We work closely with health partners to tackle the harms of substance misuse including PS and to provide staff and prisoners with the tools support and information they need. This includes operational guidance learning/ training days and a toolkit for clinical and operational staff and leaflets/ posters radio campaigns and drug-related interventions for prisoners.As part of our commitments in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper published in November 2016 we will invest to strengthen the frontline with 2500 additional prison officers by 2018. These new prison officers will receive dedicated substance misuse training which explains the substantial impact of drug use particularly psychoactive substances implementation of the Psychoactive Substance Act 2016 in prisons and insight into what they can do to prevent further PS supply and use.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many dogs trained to detect new psychoactive substances are deployed at each prison.,The Ministry of Justice and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) takes seriously the ongoing challenges that substance misuse including psychoactive substances (PS) pose to our establishments and we continue to implement a range of measures to address both the availability and use of such harmful substances. This is based on a multi-agency approach working closely with health partners and law enforcement agencies.We welcome the work that the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) has done to draw further attention to the role that psychoactive substances have played in a number of deaths in prison custody and the lessons from his investigations into these cases are informing our programme of work to prevent self-inflicted deaths in custody and to improve safety in prisons more generally.We have not made an assessment of the impact of PS on reoffending but know that that substance misuse more widely is associated with higher rates of reoffending.Figures drawn from the HMPPS Incident Reporting System suggest there were just over 4000 incidents where psychoactive substances were found in prisons between August 2016 and July 2017 in England and Wales. Prisons have at their disposal a range of security measures to reduce the supply of drugs into prisons including physical searching the use of x-ray machines CCTV surveillance cameras intelligence-led searches as well as drug detection dogs. HMPPS have trained more than 300 dogs to detect PS and these dogs are available to all prisons. HMPPS are also exploring additional innovative security measures and new technology to complement existing searching methods in prisons.The introduction of mandatory drug testing for psychoactive substances in prisons in September 2016 was also a significant step to support our prisons in tackling the supply and use of these lethal drugs. We are not aware of any other prison service in the world that has introduced these innovative new tests.There were 27277 random mandatory drug tests administered between October 2016 and March 2017. Each sample taken is tested for a range of illicit drugs including psychoactive substances. As these are random drugs tests prisoners tested in a single month are unique but an individual prisoner could be chosen in multiple months. Figures for 2017/18 will be published in the Annual HMPPS Digest in July 2018.We routinely and regularly conduct research to determine the range of substances in prisons to ensure that we are testing for the substances that are most commonly used.Drug treatment also plays an important role in tackling PS in prisons. Substance misuse services in England are commissioned through NHS England to provide a range of services to support recovery and rehabilitation. We work closely with health partners to tackle the harms of substance misuse including PS and to provide staff and prisoners with the tools support and information they need.

The time required to provide data going back to 1997/98 would incur disproportionate cost. We do not hold information on the overall proportion of the prison population that made a complaint or the proportion of the estimated transgender prisoner population for the time periods requested. There may be other similar cases where the PPO investigated a death but were not aware of the person having previously identified as transgender and therefore their death would not be included in these figures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the weight of drugs recovered in prisons was in each year since 2010 broken down (a) by suspected drug type and (b) by (i) class A (ii) class B and (iii) class C.,The attached table shows all drug finds by type since 2010. The data is not recorded in a way that allows direct comparison with Schedules of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Drug finds in prisons are recorded in broad categories of drug type which would not take into account any differences in classifications for drugs of a similar type. Data on the weight of drugs found has been available since October 2015 when an enhanced reporting system was introduced. This enabled the selection of psychoactive substances categories. Please note that the data records the weight of all drugs found in an incident but not separately for each individual drug type.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of pilot prisons and additional powers for governors; and if he will make a statement.,A process evaluation is underway on the pilot prisons and this learning has informed the development of the additional powers for governors announced in the white paper. Work is underway to develop an evaluation strategy for the full Prison Reform programme which will incorporate the additional powers for governors.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when he plans to publish proposals on the future of the prison estate in England and Wales.,On 3 November 2016 the then Secretary of State for Justice published a White Paper on Prison Safety and Reform outlining the Ministry of Justices plans for radical reform of the prison system. This included an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate improve education and empower governors to help tackle violence reduce reoffending and keep staff and prisoners safe. As part of our wholescale reforms we are investing £1.3bn to modernise the estate. This will include closing older prisons that are not fit for purpose and creating in their place high-quality modern establishments On 22 March 2017 we announced plans subject to planning approvals value for money and affordability to build four modern prisons: adjacent to HM Prison Full Sutton in Yorkshire (with a pre-planning consultation event held on 11 and 12 April 2017) Port Talbot in Neath and redevelop HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Rochester in Kent and HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Hindley in Greater Manchester. This is in addition to the plans previously announced for new sites at former HMP Wellingborough and HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Glen Parva. On the 19 July 2017 we announced that we still plan to redevelop the prisons at Rochester and Hindley as part of our prison modernisation programme. However cells at these sites will be kept in use for now as part of forward-planning for the estate. No further decisions have been made beyond those that have already been announced.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the Answer of 16 November 2015 to Question 15648 and to the Answer of 17 July 2017 to Question 4436 for what reasons the policy on the disclosure of data on the seizures of drones in prisons has changed.,The risks presented by the illicit use of drones in prisons are significant as is the profound impact on prison safety and security. We rightly take a zero tolerance approach to smuggling of contraband into prisons and work closely with the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ensure those caught are prosecuted. To date there has been a total of 35 arrests and 11 convictions of criminals involved in drone activity Ò resulting in those convicted are sentenced to a total of more than 40 years in jail. I consider that there are risks presented by the publication of the data requested which have the potential to cause further instability and increase violence and disorder in prisons prejudicing the safe running of our institutions. The data requested would be likely to be used by some to subvert the effectiveness of our current counter measures. This is because the information is likely to prove invaluable to those engaged in criminality within prisons. Disclosure of this information could also prejudice any ongoing investigation of a drone incident and risk alerting possible suspects as well as weaken the possibilities of future arrests.

In addition a range of methods to counter the threat posed by drones are being trialled and evaluated for their effectiveness across the prison estate. We have already introduced new legislation to further strengthen our powers making it illegal to land a drone in a prison or to use a drone to drop in contraband. We have had successful prosecutions due to intelligence led operations and working closely with the local police forces to prevent the use of drones to smuggle contraband into prisons. To date there has been a total of 35 arrests and 11 convictions of criminals involved in drone activity Ò resulting in those convicted sentenced to a total of more than 40 years in jail.

Prison officers are provided with guidance on dementia and also receive advice and guidance from occupational therapists and social workers at a local level. We are working closely with clinical leaders and social care services to improve our understanding of the impacts of dementia across prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps the Government is taking to bring about the release of prisoners subject to a sentence of imprisonment for public protection who have served their tariff.,The release of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) who have completed their tariff is a matter for the independent Parole Board. Before directing the release of an IPP prisoner the Board must be satisfied that his detention is no longer necessary for the protection of the public. Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) have worked hard in supporting the Parole Board to reduce significantly the backlog of oral hearings for IPP prisoners. Earlier this year HMPPS set up a new unit to support this effort has now embedded the learning in all pre-release casework so as to enhance the efficiency of the parole process.<br> HMPPS is focused on giving IPP prisoners the support opportunities and motivation they need to progress more quickly when they are reviewed by the Parole Board so that they have the best possible prospect for securing release. HMPPS and the Parole Board have implemented a joint action plan the purpose of which is to deliver further improvements and efficiencies in the effort to help IPP prisoners progress towards release. During 2016/17 46% of all IPP prisoners considered by the Parole Board were released and 24% recommended for a move to open conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps he is taking to ensure that Category C male prisoners from North Wales are considered for transfer to HM Prison Berwyn.,When fully operational in 2018 HMP Berwyn will provide an initial point of custody for North Wales prisoners. Following sentence men from North Wales will remain at HMP Berwyn unless the prison is unable to meet their offender management needs. In this way HMP Berwyn will become the default prison for men from North Wales unless their needs can be better met elsewhere. Men from North Wales<sup>1</sup> currently serving their sentences in other prisons will also be considered for transfer to HMP Berwyn if the prison can meet their needs and the prisoner meets the acceptance criteria. <sup>1 </sup>This will be based on their home address on reception into custody. If no address is given then an offenders committal court address is used as a proxy for the area in which they are resident.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners (a) requested and (b) were granted access to laptop computer facilities in each year since 2010.,All prisoners are able to request access to IT for legal purposes. However there is a clear need to balance the need to access electronic legal information with the risk that some prisoners may seek to use IT for illicit or criminal purposes. Therefore prisoners are only provided with IT equipment where there is a clear and genuine need and where not to do so would raise a real risk of prejudicing the legal proceedings. Where such a requirement is clear a prisoner can be provided with IT for the sole specified purpose of considering digital evidence. The IT can be made available for as long as the requirement to use it remains up to the conclusion of the relevant legal proceedings.There is currently no national guidance on the process for access to digital evidence (formerly access to justice).

Therefore none of the lost tags relate to individuals who are still subject to electronic monitoring. [1] The data applies to Radio Frequency (RF) Personal Identification Devices (tags) only. [2] The data applies to Radio Frequency (RF) Personal Identification Devices (tags) only.÷Broken indicates the RF tag was sent for repair. There are a variety of reasons why PIDS can be sent for repair including (but not restricted too) low battery life damage (including that caused by the subject) and faults. The need for a repair can be determined at any time thus not all PIDS sent for repair will have been fitted to a subject. A fault may be established during the installation process hence there should not be assumed to be a relationship between the numbers of repairs and the actively monitored caseload. Damage is most often caused by the subjects wearing the PID so it should not be assumed that damage is the result of a manufacturing issue. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of whether convicted prisoners from non-UK EU member states will be repatriated after the UK leaves the EU.,The UK participates in the EU Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision (Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA). This provides for the transfer of sentenced prisoners between Member States of the EU. All eligible prisoners are identified for transfer and referred to the Home Office for deportation action. Looking ahead we need to negotiate the best deal we can with the Europe Union and we are working across Government to consider options for our future arrangements with the EU in criminal justice matters. It is too early to speculate on what these arrangements might look like in terms of prisoner transfers with EU Member States.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when he plans to publish the findings of his Department's review into Transforming Rehabilitation.,We have carried out an overarching review of the probation system to improve outcomes for offenders and communities while making sure public protection remains our top priority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what changes his Department has made to the funding of community rehabilitation companies.,We have undertaken an overarching review of probation looking at the standards we set for providers and how we hold them to account.

The details of these changes are commercially sensitive however the contract modification notices are published online at the Official Journal for the European Union.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the process is for (a) determining the category of prisoners to be held in a prison and (b) changing the category of prisoners to be incarcerated in (i) an existing and (ii) a planned prison.,All prisoners undergo a thorough individual risk assessment following conviction and sentencing and placed in a prison suitable to their risk. Assessed risks are risk of escape and of harm to the public in the event of escape/abscond and risk to the good order of the establishment and the safety of those within it. The prison estate is organised in categories of risk ranging from category A for the highest risk offenders to category D for those posing the lowest risk. Balanced alongside this is the need to separate specific cohorts of prisoners such as women and young people and deal with prisoners who are particularly difficult or whose management requires particular expertise such as very high risk or especially vulnerable prisoners. The procedure for changing a prisons security categorisation would be the same for new prisons as existing ones. This includes a comprehensive assessment of the physical security of a prisons infrastructure the necessary staffing levels to manage the desired population and the adequacy of ancillary and partner services including health care activities and education.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what his Department's policy is on building a new prison in Port Talbot.,We are investing £1.3 billion to reform and modernise the prison estate to replace ageing and ineffective prisons with up to 10000 modern prison places.

This is in addition to our plans to redevelop the sites at the former HMP Wellingborough and at HMP &amp; YOI Glen Parva. The plans include a new prison in Port Talbot in South Wales. The Ministry of Justice intends to apply for planning permission in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners who have attended rehabilitation courses in prison have reoffended in each of the last five years.,Information on offenders released from prison in England and Wales who have attended Accredited Offending Behaviour Programmes is held on individual prisoner files.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average amount of time was that the Prison and Probation Ombudsman spent on an investigation into a self-inflicted death in each year since 2010.,The PPO is able to quantify the time spent on an investigation into self-inflicted deaths by looking at the time it takes to issue an initial report. For self-inflicted death investigations there is a timeliness target of 26 (working) weeks from the point of notification until when the initial report is issued.The following table presents for each calendar year the average number of working weeks that a self-inflicted case took from the start of the investigation to the initial report being issued.  <table><tbody> 2010201120122013201420152016Working weeks46.240.838.128.925.724.124.5Number of initial reports issued725783669284103</tbody></table>
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what mandatory training on working with victims of sexual and domestic abuse is undertaken by (a) the judiciary (b) the police and (c) probation staff.,Responsibility for the training of judges and magistrates is the responsibility of the Lord Chief Justice. There has been comprehensive training across both the family and criminal jurisdictions for both judges and magistrates who hear cases involving both sexual and domestic abuse. The Judges role is to ensure a fair trial takes place and that all parties are able to give their best evidence. To that end special measures can be used in court in order to assist those with any vulnerabilities. Training includes learning about the effects of sexual and domestic abuse. All new police recruits receive mandatory training on domestic abuse rape and sexual offences as part of the National Policing Curriculum. Additional in-depth training on domestic abuse developed by the voluntary sector is being rolled out to forces across the country. Training on child safeguarding and domestic abuse is mandatory for all National Probation Service staff. This includes Victim Liaison Officers who will work directly with victims of domestic and sexual abuse. This consists of separate e-learning on safeguarding and domestic abuse awareness for all staff and a combined classroom based component for practitioners and their line managers. The learning highlights that many offenders may be victims of domestic abuse and draws the learners attention to reflect this in their work considering referrals to other agencies as appropriate. Training must be repeated every three years to ensure knowledge and skills are kept up to date.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether he will reform ground rules hearings to exclude the cross-examination of victims in rape trials about their sexual histories.,Section 41 regulates the admissibility of evidence or questions relating to a complainants sexual history. Applications to admit evidence or questions must be made in writing no later than 28 days after full prosecution disclosure and specify the particulars of the evidence or questions. If the Court allows the application it must specify the scope of questioning or evidence permitted. A ground rules hearing is not required to do so but may provide the forum for this process. The Attorney General and the previous Justice Secretary commissioned a review of how section 41 is operating in practice. Ministers will consider the findings shortly.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what special measures are available for victims involved in sexual assault or rape proceedings.,There are a range of special measures in place for vulnerable and intimidated victims and witnesses in criminal justice proceedings.

The measures available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses include the power for a court to order arrangements for live video links video recorded evidence in chief and screens around the witness box. Courts are also able to order that vulnerable victims and witnesses receive assistance with communication including the use of an intermediary to help them understand the questions they are being asked and to give their answers accurately. We have partially commenced the provision of pre-recorded cross examination of vulnerable witnesses in 3 crown court centres. This partial commencement will be extended to complainants in sexual and modern slavery offences for cases starting in September 2017.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the provisions of the Courts Bill as introduced will include measures to provide targeted and supportive care to prisoners.,The Government remains absolutely committed to continuing to reform our prisons delivering the commitments set out in our white paper to make them places of safety and reform.These priorities can be delivered through operational changes without legislation and so will not be in the Courts Bill. An example of what this means in terms of targeted and supportive care to prisoners is the introduction of a new offender management model. One aspect of this is the new keyworker role; every residential officer will responsible for supervising and supporting a small caseload of offenders. Key Workers will motivate challenge and encourage individuals to use their time in custody to the best effect assisting them to access the support and assistance they require to turn their lives around. Prisoners are also far more likely to suffer from mental health issues than the general population which is why were investing in specialist mental health training for prison officers to help reduce the worrying levels of self-harm and suicide in our prisons. We are also increasing support to those at risk of self-harm or suicide especially in the first 24 hours when we know offenders are at their most vulnerable and working with the Health Secretary to increase the use of community sentences with mental health requirements so prison is not used as a last resort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the provisions of the Courts Bill as introduced will include measures to reduce the level of suicide and self-harm in prisons.,The Courts Bill will reform our courts and tribunal system to improve access to justice making better use of technology and modernising working practices. While the Bill does not include clauses on prisons work to reduce levels of suicide and self-harm in prisons is already underway and does not require primary legislation.New training is being rolled out across the estate to support our staff to identify the risks and triggers of suicide and self-harm and understand what they can do to support prisoners at risk.We have put in place specialist roles - regional safer custody leads - in every region to provide advice to prisons and to spread good practice on identifying and supporting prisoners at risk.We are using experts Ò including providing extra funding for the Samaritans Ò to provide targeted support for prison staff and to prisoners directly. We are also auditing existing processes in each prisons for identifying managing and helping prisoners at risk so that we can identify best practice and target improvements where needed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps his Department is taking to improve National Probation Service effectiveness for cases (a) of domestic abuse and (b) involving the safeguarding of children.,The National Probation Service (NPS) is responsible for assessing the level of risk posed by each offender under its supervision and ensuring that a robust plan is in place to manage any risk which the offender presents with respect to domestic abuse or to harming children. Her Majestys Prisons and Probation Service (HMPPS) has recently created a Directorate to lead a major programme to ensure that the NPSs operational practice is of the highest standard. All NPS staff are required to complete a training package on child safeguarding and domestic abuse and repeat the training every three years to ensure that their knowledge and skills are kept up to date. To support its contribution to local multi-agency arrangements the NPS has developed a series of National Partnership Strategy Frameworks. They cover the NPSs involvement in multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) for high risk domestic abuse victims and Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). (a) For domestic abuse NPS staff are required to be alert to the possibility that there might be issues relating to domestic abuse in every case they manage and not just in those cases where the offender is already convicted of an offence in which domestic abuse is involved. The NPS is able to purchase specialist interventions from the Community Rehabilitation Companies to address the risk of domestic abuse. The then National Offender Management Service (NOMS) now Her Majestys Prisons and Probation Service produced and promulgated updated Domestic Abuse Guidance in August 2016. (b) The NPS issued a Child Safeguarding Policy Statement in January this year to replace interim guidance. NPS staff now have access to a range of safeguarding toolkits information quality assurance tools and practice guidance. In addition the NPS has produced and promulgated a guide to staff supervising perpetrators of child sexual exploitation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to ensure that Prison Service staff undertaking the same work receive the same level of remuneration.,In 2012 NOMS introduced significant reforms to their pay and grading structures through the introduction of ÷Fair and Sustainable. The reforms included the introduction of a new job evaluation scheme standardised job descriptions and a new pay structure and aimed to mitigate equal pay risk. All jobs are evaluated using the Job Evaluation Scheme (JES) and this determines the pay band the role it falls within. The pay for operational prison staff including officers is considered on an annual basis by the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) based on evidence relating to private sector pay structures public sector pay policy recruitment and retention of staff budget restrictions set by HM Treasury and the UK economy growth and inflation forecasts. We have however taken a number of steps to improve remuneration for prison officers over the past year including: <ul>Increasing the rates of Payment Plus and Tornado allowances for staff working extra hours or taking on additional duties.Announced plans to introduce temporary market supplements to our 31 hardest to recruit sites for the remainder of this Parliament which will boost prison offer pay by up to £5000.Creating 2000 new senior positions available for promotion which provide further opportunities for officers to boost their take home pay as part of our continued plans to professionalise the workforce.</ul> A number of prison officers remain in the old Ïclosed pay structures and are unlikely to opt into the new structures due to the salary differential. NOMS is looking at all potential options to bring all staff into Fair and Sustainable terms and onto the same pay structures.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of trends in the level of turnover of prison staff; and what steps she is taking to support retention and recruitment of such staff.,"Information on the NOMS workforce and staff turnover by region is published quarterly at <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-offender-management-service-workforce-statistics\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-offender-management-service-workforce-statistics</a>. The Government is determined to ensure that prisons are properly staffed to deliver safety and security. We will be recruiting an additional 2500 prison officers across the prison estate and have run a localised recruitment process at 30 of our difficult to recruit sites to support the national recruitment campaign. At 31 prisons with the most difficult recruitment and retention issues officers now receive a boost under a scheme offering higher starting pay and an additional allowance of up to £5000 and 2000 new promotions. We are addressing attrition levels in a number of ways including the appointment of 75 mentors dedicated to supporting new recruits in their first year and the setting up of a HR Response Team to provide interventions to establishments with rising attrition."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the effect of raising the retirement age of prison officers to 68 years old on safety in prisons.,The recently published White Paper on prison reform announced a major shake-up of the prison system with 2500 extra prisons officers and new security measures to tackle drones phones and drugs. This is a key priority for the Government as we seek to make sure our prisons are safe decent and secure and places of reform. Safe systems of work and health and safety systems are in place across the prison estate to ensure that staff work in an environment that is as safe and secure as possible and that they are supported to deal with the challenges of working with offenders. The Prison Service has systems in place to deal with perpetrators quickly and robustly with serious incidents referred to the police for prosecution. We are working with the Police and Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that prisoners who assault staff are charged wherever possible and punished appropriately. We are comprehensively reviewing how we manage violence in prisons with a view to introducing further improvements to ensure prisons are safer places for everyone. This will provide Governors/Directors with the tools to create safer prison environments and to help reduce re-offending. In December 2016 the Government made a pay and pensions offer to the Prison Officers Association (POA) which included a proposed reduction in the effective pension age which would allow officers to retire at 65. Unfortunately POA members voted to reject this deal and therefore the pension age has remain unchanged. The Prison Service regularly meet with all of the Unions representing staff in the prisons and probation services and is committed to continued constructive dialogue on all matters including pensions and remuneration.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what support she has made available to prison offices experiencing mental health issues as a result of their employment.,NOMS is committed to providing safe decent and secure places of work and takes the health safety and wellbeing of its employees extremely seriously. The Ministry of Justice is investing an extra £100m annually to boost the frontline by 2500 officers. NOMS also recognises that the physical emotional and social wellbeing of employees is paramount to attracting and retaining staff that will build a strong and capable organisation. All NOMS staff have access to an occupational health service and employee assistance programme. This includes 24 hour 365 days a year access to signposting and counselling; trauma support services; a wide ranging health promotion website and personal wellbeing zone. As well as access to comprehensive occupational health services and self-referral for confidential counselling specialist counselling such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is also available to staff who have experienced trauma. Fast track referrals to see an occupational health nurse are encouraged for staff who have experienced trauma and where staff are absent as a result of a mental and behavioural disorder an immediate referral to occupational health is recommended. Care teams comprising of prison service staff provide an immediate source of peer support and signpost staff to all of the services available.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will bring forward proposals to reduce the retirement age of prison officers to bring it in line with the retirement age for police officers.,Under the recommendations made in the 2011 Lord Hutton Report on public sector pensions the normal pension age (retirement age) for Police Officers increased from 55 to 60 with the expectation of further reviews which may increase the age towards (or up to) the state pension age which is currently set at between 66 and 68 depending on the individuals date of birth. Those employed as police officers and members of the Police Pension Scheme fund a normal pension age of 60 through higher employee contributions than those employed as prison officers and members of the Civil Service Pension Scheme. Police officers contribute 12.44% of their pensionable pay whereas prison officers contribute 5.45% of their pensionable pay. To reduce the normal pension age under the Civil Service Pension would require a change under legislation and a significant increase to contributions made by the employee into the scheme. In December 2016 however the Government made a pay and pensions offer to the Prison Officers Association (POA) which included a proposed reduction in the effective pension age which would allow officers to retire at 65. Unfortunately POA members voted to reject this deal and therefore the pension age has remain unchanged. The Prison Service regularly meet with all of the Unions representing staff in the prisons and probation services and is committed to continued constructive dialogue on all matters including pensions and remuneration.

Where necessary we provide safer cells which are designed to minimise the availability of ligature points and thereby to make an act of suicide or self-harm as difficult as possible. This is an important part of our approach to suicide prevention. Where a prisoner is accommodated in a safer cell this forms only a part of the package of support measures that are put in place to manage the risk of self-harm or suicide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 17 February 2017 to Question 64699 whether she plans further to increase the number of prison service staff working on investigations into alleged corruption in prisons.,The vast majority of prison staff undertake their duties with honesty and integrity. But this Government is committed to investigating and eliminating corruption where it exists to ensure prisons remain a safe and secure environment for staff prisoners and visitors. A dedicated team of officials work to prevent and tackle corruption and investigate alleged corruption across prisons and probation. In addition to this all prisons have an identified Local Corruption Prevention Manager (LCPM) responsible for developing intelligence raising awareness of corruption prevention and supporting staff to report any corruption related concerns. And in support of our commitment to tackle this threat we have just invested an extra £3 million to improve intelligence analysis and searching capability across prisons and probation Ò this investment will increase our ability to identify and tackle corruption. A range of measures set out in the recent Prison Safety and Reform White Paper will further bolster our response to driving out corruption in prisons. Our new approach will drive closer working with the police; deliver tougher responses with robust outcomes; and increase support and training for staff. In carrying out this work we will continue to ensure that sufficient resources remain available to tackle the threat now and for the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of the prisons budget was spent on prisoners' (a) education (b) healthcare and (c) rehabilitation in 2015-16.,As part of our prison safety and reform plans we are giving governors in all prisons more powers and more responsibility. This includes key roles at each stage of the healthcare commissioning cycle and the ability to decide how to structure their education regime how it is sequenced and who provides it. These new responsibilities for prison governors will be accompanied by new accountability buttressed by a set of performance standards that will hold them to account for the progress prisoners make. The budget for education and healthcare in 2015-16 was the responsibility of other Government Departments or a devolved function of the Welsh Government. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills allocated £128.9m for prison education in that year. The Department for Health allocated spend on offender health in 2015/16 but it is not possible to breakdown how much of this was spent in prisons. In the case of some Privately Managed Prisons education and healthcare was delivered by the prison operator and funded as part of the overall contract price. These costs are therefore not all held in the budget overseen by NOMS to deliver services in prisons. We do not allocate a separate budget for rehabilitation. Offender rehabilitation is an integral part of the prison regime from offending behaviour programmes to working in prison catering services.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 8 March 2017 to Question 65939 whether she plans that prisoners following a prison education regime will be tested in line with the core common curriculum set nationally by accredited examination boards; and whether it is her policy that the results of prisoner examinations at GCSE or A-level will be considered in national education averages and in national examination grade curves.,Improving levels of education is an important goal for offenders. As well as applying our maths and English focussed core common curriculum which will be set nationally prison governors will be encouraged to work with local employers and use labour market data to choose the right vocational training to help offenders into employment. Vocational and other qualifications can play an important part in communicating an individuals competences in a clear and reliable way and acting as signposts for the progress he or she has made. Where it makes sense to accredit education and vocational training delivered in custody through the award of a qualification the appropriate awarding bodys curriculum will be used to prepare the learner for the end assessment leading to the award of that qualification. GCSEs A levels or other qualifications where studied for and achieved by adults in prisons are not included in the performance tables or national averages published by the Department for Education. Some prisoners are released on temporary licence to study at local Colleges: where a prisoner aged 18 is enrolled in learning with a mainstream provider outside the prison qualifications achieved are included in the performance tables and national averages. All learners that take the GCSE or A Level qualification including those taken in custody are considered in national examination grade curves. Their results are included within the Joint Council for Qualifications published figures in the summer following the exams. Although the setting of the boundaries is informed by the subset of students that are matched to their prior attainment which is not always possible with adult learners the boundaries apply to all students. We intend in future to measure education and training in prisons by assessing a prisoners progress against milestones set out in their Personal Learning Plan itself an element of the overall sentence plan. Studying for a GCSE or an A level should be part of a Personal Learning Plan where such study is appropriate. If such study is on the learners individual plan as a milestone the prisons governor will be accountable for performance towards its achievement

Of these 298 resulted in immediate custody and 66 in a suspended sentence.(b) 535 sentencing occasions resulting in a custodial sentence where the offender was previously convicted or cautioned for a violence against the person offence (other than knife possession). Of these 375 resulted in immediate custody and 160 in a suspended sentence. The figures reflect whether the offender had a previous conviction or caution for a violence against the person offence (other than knife possession) before they committed their subsequent knife possession offence. The conviction or caution for the violence against the person offence may have occurred at the same time as or on a separate occasion to the previous knife possession offence. The figures provided include both adult and juvenile offenders."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many staff are available in Wales for the community supervision of people sentenced to less than 12 months; and what assessment she has made of the adequacy of provision of buildings and educational opportunities for those people.,All CRCs are contractually required to ensure that their workforce is competent and efficient and have appropriate and relevant qualifications training and experience and to employ or engage a sufficient number of staff to deliver the services set out in their contracts.CRCs are also contractually required to make staff aware of and attend scheduled training with respect to practices and procedures which are relevant to their roles. During the procurement and transformation processes staffing numbers estates proposals and educational opportunities were assessed and we robustly contract manage each CRC to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to maintain service delivery reduce reoffending and protect the public. We also ensure that all transformation plans including estates from which the services are delivered are implemented appropriately.We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of the probation system to make sure it is reducing reoffending protecting the public and reducing future victims. We will set out our plans after the review is concluded in April.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many offenders supervised by (a) the National Probation Service and (b) the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales were taken back to prison having missed appointments in (i) 2014 (ii) 2015 and (iii) 2016.,We do not hold data on reason for recall centrally. Failure to attend appointments would be recorded as either the generic ÷failure to comply or the specific ÷failure to register where the recall was related to failing to attend the initial post-release appointment. It would not be possible to collate how many of the ÷failure to comply/register recalls were in relation to breached curfews without checking each individual case. The information therefore can only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to review the capability of (a) HM Prison Service and (b) contracted-out prisons to respond to incidents of concerted indiscipline.,Concerted indiscipline is defined as an incident in which two or more prisoners act together in defiance of a lawful instruction or against the requirements of the regime of the establishment. Such incidents can cover wide range of circumstances with most quickly resolved locally but others requiring varying levels of more significant intervention. We are continually reviewing prisons across the public and private estates and supporting them to mitigate the risk of serious incidents and provide effective responses to incidents that do occur. This process draws on a wide range of local data and intelligence reported daily by Governors and assessed alongside other data such as independent assessments from Her Majestys Inspectorate of Prisons. I review this data regularly with the Chief Executive and other senior leaders. Interventions available to prevent risks escalating include deploying extra staff on detached duty and overtime installing extra CCTV or making fast improvements to building facilities where damage presents risks. Measures are also taken when appropriate to segregate prisoners provide extra detection or blocking equipment and provide additional search teams. Under the mutual aid process there are agreements between both public and private prisons which enable them to support each other to respond to significant incidents effectively. If the incident is significant enough we bolster the local response by deploying specialist (Tornado) teams. Following this we help stabilise prisons after incidents by transferring disruptive prisoners. In response to incidents in late 2016 we are improving this existing capability by resourcing two additional national dog teams to support more perimeter patrols helping prevent throw overs and drone operations. We are also increasing the number of Tornado-trained staff by 10%. In addition as part of our wider investment in staffing levels we are increasing intelligence and dedicated search capability at prison level. In the longer-term we are improving prisons capacity to mitigate and respond to risks of incidents by increasing prison officer numbers by 2500 and introducing of a new offender management model. Under this model residential officers in public sector prisons will have a caseload of 6 prisoners each to support and challenge. We expect private prisons to offer a model which also provides one-to-one support for each prisoner.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of (a) community sentences and (b) suspended prison sentences included a Mental Health Treatment Requirement in each year since 2010.,"The table shows the proportion of offenders starting (a) community orders or (b) suspended sentence orders under probation supervision in each year since 2010 where a mental health treatment requirement was attached to the order. <table><tbody> Community orderSuspended sentence orderYear<td colspan=\2\""><em>Percentage</em>20100.60.520110.50.520120.50.420130.60.520140.70.620150.50.5</tbody></table> We need a more systematic nationally consistent approach that provides quicker and more certain access to mental health treatment for offenders who need it. This will stop offenders getting into a position which leads to a custodial sentence. The Justice Secretary is working closely with the Health Secretary who is extremely committed to this and NHS England to develop a new mental health protocol. This will ensure timely access to mental health services where the courts impose a mental health treatment requirement as part of a sentence. The Justice Secretary is also working with the Judiciary and the Health Secretary to make sure courts have better access to psychologists to diagnose and oversee treatment of offenders."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice on how many occasions in the last year private prisons have required the support of HM Prison Service to deal with concerted indiscipline.,HM Prison Service and other contracted establishment resources have been deployed to contracted prisons as part of our established mutual aid arrangements to assist with the resolution of concerted indiscipline on three occasions within the last twelve months. The details are as follows;<ul>17 July 2016 Doncaster01 September 2016 Lowdham Grange16 December 2016 Birmingham</ul> On each occasion the National Tactical Response Group were also deployed to provide specialist incident management support including advanced tactical options advice planning and development of intervention options.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to review the level of compliance with prison service instructions on prisoner escort.,The instructions on the external escort of prisoners is set out in Prison Service Instruction 33/2015. This provides comprehensive security procedures to be applied when a prisoner is to be escorted outside the establishment. These procedures are subject to local monitoring and approval. In addition to this all security compliance is monitored through a central programme of audit and assurance. All serious breaches of security during escort (including prisoner escape) are investigated and any resulting recommendations carefully considered. Prisoners are only moved outside the security of the prison when necessary and where the purpose of the escort cannot be met within the prison. The overwhelming majority of escorts pass without incident.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent assessment she has made of the effect of guidelines for tougher sentences for knife crimes on the numbers of people imprisoned for such crimes.,"After the introduction of our two strikes legislation people caught carrying a knife a second time are now more likely than ever before to go to prison. The government continues to monitor sentencing for bladed and offensive weapon offences. On 9 March the latest knife possession sentencing quarterly statistics bulletin was published and is available at <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/knife-possession-sentencing-quarterly-brief-october-to-december-2016\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/knife-possession-sentencing-quarterly-brief-october-to-december-2016</a>. Sentencing Guidelines are produced by the independent Sentencing Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when she plans to answer Questions (a) 55553 on prison sentences: Lancashire tabled on 30 November 2016 (b) 62826 on Members: correspondence tabled on 21 February 2017 and (c) 64827 on electronic tagging tabled on 21 February 2017 by the hon. Member for Preston; and whether she plans to respond to the letter on Questions 55553 and 64827 sent by email and post by the hon. Member for Preston on 3 March 2017.,Question 55553 on prison sentences: Lancashire was answered on 09 March 2017. Question 62826 is not a PQ that was tabled to the Ministry of Justice. The department assumes the hon. Member for Preston was referring to 64826 on Members correspondence which was answered on 15 March 2017 question 64827 on electronic tagging was answered on 16 March 2017. The Secretary of State has responded to the letter on Questions 55553 and 64827 sent by email and post via letter on Friday 17 March 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 31 January 2017 to Question 61344 on prisons: electronic equipment what information her Department holds on the number of (a) game consoles and (b) televisions in prisons.,Some 19000 television sets were issued to public sector prisons in the 12 month period ending on 28 February 2017. This is fairly standard and costs are recovered from the rental payments made by prisoners. However information on the numbers of games consoles and televisions in use within prisons is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what instructions are given to staff of the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales to be followed when an offender under supervision misses three or more appointments without good reason.,Where offenders are not complying with their sentences probation providers must take swift and robust action with offenders returned to court for breach proceedings where appropriate. All enforcement procedures are set out in Probation Instructions and both CRCs and the NPS must follow the practice specified in mandatory actions within these. Data on missed appointments by offenders are not collected centrally and can only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice for what reasons the Enhanced Voluntary Redundancy scheme was withdrawn by the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales and replaced by a severance scheme; and what assessment she has made of the financial effects of that change on employees.,All CRCs are required by their contracts to make sure they have sufficient appropriately-qualified staff to deliver contractual services. The Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) in Wales has given assurance that it has met its obligations under the terms of the Enhanced Voluntary Redundancy scheme which was used between October 2015 and July 2016. A separate and distinct Voluntary Severance Scheme has since been offered by employee agreement allowing the CRC to offer terms to a greater number of staff.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many offenders under the supervision of the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales missed eight appointments without good reason during 2015; and what steps were taken in each such case.,Where offenders are not complying with their sentences probation providers must take swift and robust action with offenders returned to court for breach proceedings where appropriate. All enforcement procedures are set out in Probation Instructions and both CRCs and the NPS must follow the practice specified in mandatory actions within these. Data on missed appointments by offenders are not collected centrally and can only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people who were supervised by the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales have entered paid employment or education following (a) supervision after completing a sentence of 12 months or less and (b) an interview with education and employment staff in the latest period for which figures are available.,This information is not collected centrally and can only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The Probation Service Review proposed that probation providers measure outcomes which include Housing Education and Employment monitoring at specific key points throughout the offenders journey including commencement and end of supervision periods. The measure is proposed for implementation in due course and guidance has been issued to inform recording practice to capture this data. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many persons sentenced to 12 months or less have been supervised by the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales since that Company was established.,The Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) in Wales was established on 1 June 2014. However the statutory duty for CRCs to supervise offenders released into the community from custodial sentences of 12 months or less came into force with the Offender Rehabilitation Act on 1 February 2015. Between 1 February 2015 and 30 September 2016 3315 such offenders were released into supervision under Wales CRC.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether she has any plans to use the redeveloped Glen Parva Prison to accommodate prisoners from Leicester Prison when it is complete.,We are investing £1.3bn to build up to 10000 new prison places with better education facilities and other rehabilitative services. We will close down ageing and ineffective prisons replacing them with buildings fit for todays demands. The new prison development at HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Glen Parva will be suitable for category C male prisoners. Prisoners transferring to the new prison on the Glen Parva site may come from any appropriate prison in the estate depending on their personal and resettlement needs.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales has met its obligations under the terms of the Enhanced Voluntary Redundancy scheme.,All CRCs are required by their contracts to make sure they have sufficient appropriately-qualified staff to deliver contractual services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to ensure that prisoners receive the education they need to ensure a reduction in reoffending.,We are clear that our prisons must become places of discipline hard work and self-improvement for offenders to improve their maths and English and get a job on release<br> Alongside our work to boost staffing numbers these reforms will help offenders turn their lives around reduce reoffending and create safer communities. Our recent White Paper on prison reform described how we have already stripped out unnecessary rules and governance from our education contracts to allow governors more oversight and control of existing services. Over the coming months we will make prison governors fully responsible for education provision in their prisons once existing contracts end commissioning the services they think are most appropriate in their individual prison. This will allow governors to decide how to structure their educational regime and who delivers it while following a core common curriculum set nationally which will focus on maths and English. To support this prisons will create a personalised learning plan based on an assessment of need on reception integrating it into the individuals sentence plan and we will use the same awarding bodies for particular types of provision to enable continuity of learning if prisoners move elsewhere. To ensure the quality of education delivery in prison improves we will make sure that those providing that education have the right skills and capabilities to do so. The White Paper <em>Prison Safety and Reform</em> set out a suite of performance measures through which governors will be held to account for outcomes in their prisons including educational progress made by prisoners. We will compare levels of attainment of maths and English on release with those at the start of custody and look at the number of qualifications or other accredited and work-focussed activity prisoners complete. In future we will develop measures that assess individual progress against milestones in a Personal Learning Plan.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate she has made of the average cost of employing a prison officer in bands 3 to 5 (a) this year and (b) in each year from 2018-19 to 2020-21.,The average annual cost to NOMS (including employers pension and National Insurance contributions) of employing Prison Officers in Bands 3 to 5 in 2016-17 is set out in the table below [it should be noted that there will be variances depending on the prison and role of the prison officer].<table><tbody>BandAverage Annual cost (£)Custodial Manager: Band 546000Supervising Officer: Band 441400Prison Officer Specialist: Band 441300Prison Officer: Band 336700</tbody></table> The cost of employing Prison Officers in future years cannot be accurately estimated as rates of pay are determined annually by the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) and are therefore not yet known.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prosecutions there have been in each of the last 10 years for improperly displayed vehicle number plates.,The number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates' courts for offences under sections 42 and 59 of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 in each year between 2011 and 2015 can be viewed in the table. From centrally collated data it has only been possible to separately identify offences under individual sections of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act from 2011 onwards.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the oral contribution of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice of 1 March 2017 Official Report column 100WH on suicide and self-harm in prison (England) when will the findings of the inquiry into deaths in custody be published; and whether that inquiry will include deaths in prison custody.,We are reviewing the circumstances of recent self-inflicted deaths in prison custody with a particular focus on cases where there were known mental health concerns.This is an internal review but we will make the key findings public as soon as they are available. Inquests into many of the deaths that are being reviewed have yet to take place and in some cases there is ongoing litigation so it would not be appropriate to publish details of individual cases.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the oral contribution of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice of 1 March 2017 Official Report column 101WH on suicide and self-harm in prison (England) how much funding her Department plans to allocate to the Samaritans; and what the targeted support for prison staff and prisoners provided by that charity will consist of.,The total amount of our funding to the Samaritans for 2017-18 has yet to be finalised although we have confirmed already that they will receive the same amount as this year (£500k) to support the Listeners scheme through which volunteer prisoners are trained to provide support to other prisoners in emotional distress. Founded in 1991 this is a very successful scheme through which over 90000 face-to-face support meetings were facilitated in 2016. In addition to funding the Samaritans for the Listeners scheme as part of plans to reduce levels of suicide and self-harm we have agreed in principle to fund a number of other projects proposed by the Samaritans and final decisions on the level of funding will be made by the end of the year. These additional projects include producing an online learning tool for prison staff based on a similar product developed by the Samaritans for the rail industry and piloting training for prisoners in building emotional resilience during their early days in custody with the training to be delivered by released ex-Listeners.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she plans to take to ensure the independence of the Prison Officers' Pay Review Body from (a) prison service management and (b) Government.,The Government respects and values the role of the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) as a compensatory mechanism for Operational staff within the Prison Service for whom the inducement to participate in industrial action is prohibited by law. The PSPRB members are independently appointed through the Public Appointments Team and the panel makes independent recommendations having considered evidence from both NOMS in agreement with wider Government and trade unions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what her plans are for the (a) building of new prisons and (b) closure of prisons constructed in the Victorian period; and if she will make a statement.,We will close down ageing and ineffective prisons replacing them with buildings fit for todays demands. HM Prison Berwyn opened at the end of February this year with a capacity of around 2100 places. In addition we will build up to 10000 further prison places on a ÷new for old basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many additional places her Department plans to create in public sector prisons in each of the next five years.,We will close down ageing and ineffective prisons replacing them with buildings fit for todays demands. HM Prison Berwyn opened at the end of February this year with a capacity of around 2100 places. In addition we will build up to 10000 further prison places on a ÷new for old basis. No decisions have yet been made on who will operate the new prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many incidents of lost keys have required the re-locking of prisons since May 2012; and what the cost of those incidents have been to the public purse.,Security is paramount within prisons and it is important that the risk of any potential key compromise is addressed as quickly as possible in order to protect the public. When a key/lock incident is reported an immediate investigation is undertaken to assess the risk and unless it is clear that security has not been compromised locking mechanisms and keys will be replaced and/or other necessary remedial action will be taken. Between 2005 and May 2010 there were 16 relocks which resulted in costs of £1280234. In the period from May 2012 to Feb 2017 there were 6 full or partial relocks of prisons in England and Wales as a result of theft or loss of keys at a total cost of £192420 to the taxpayer. Notes<ol>The cost of a relock will depend upon the size of the prison establishment and on which keys have been lost or compromised. If a complete set of keys are lost a full relock of the prison will be undertaken whereas if a single key is lost only a partial relock will be needed incurring a lower cost.Numbers of re-locks of private sector prisons are included in the above but costs of re-locks at private sector prisons are met in full by the private contractors operating the prisons at nil cost to the public purse and as such these costs are not included in the financial cost totals.Prisons are also responsible for re-locks of crown court cells. Figures exclude any numbers or costs of re-lock of cells in crown courts during the period.Figures include re-locks arising from loss of keys and where keys have been forcibly taken from staff.The figures quoted have been drawn from live administrative databases and may subsequently be amended. Due care is taken during processing and analysis but the detail is subject to inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.</ol>

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether Charles Taylor is able to make phone calls from Durham Prison.,All prisoners are eligible to make phone calls to approved numbers for both social and legal purposes and are subject to appropriate security and monitoring arrangements. Legally privileged calls remain unmonitored in line with policy requirements.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what discussions her Department has had with the Department of Health on the number of people taking their own lives in prisons in the last year.,The Ministry of Justice works closely with the Department of Health at all levels on reducing suicide and self-harm in prisons to which we are all fully committed. Ministers from both departments and from the Home Office are members of the Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody and are supported by senior officials. Department of Health officials and practitioners have specific strands of action as part of the Suicide and Self-Harm Working Group and sit on the Project Board that oversees its work. The Project is rolling out revised safer custody training to all prison officers to equip them better to identify and manage the risk of suicide and self-harm including during the early days in custody.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment her Department has made of the consistency and proportionality of imprisonment for public protection sentencing.,Assessment of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentencing found that it had been used far more widely than intended. This assessment led to its abolition by the Coalition Government in 2012 and its replacement with a new regime of determinate sentences alongside life sentences for the most serious offenders. We are taking steps namely the creation of a case progression unit and the ongoing implementation of a joint NOMS and Parole Board action plan to improve the opportunities given to remaining IPP prisoners to progress towards release. However IPP prisoners should continue to be detained if the level of risk they pose to the public cannot be safely managed in the community.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when she plans to let the contract to run Oakhill Secure Training Centre; and who the preferred bidder is for that contract.,The Ministry awarded a PFI Contract for the design construction management and financing of a Secure Training Centre at Milton Keynes (Oakhill Secure Training Centre) to STC (Milton Keynes) Ltd in May 2003. This contract is due to complete in June 2029. STC (Milton Keynes) Ltd has a subcontract with G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited for the operation of the site. G4S are undertaking a process to sell this contract as part of their announcement in February 2016 to withdraw from the childrens services market. As per previous answers to the house the Ministry has been in regular contact with G4S and other relevant bodies. This engagement includes monitoring the progress of the potential sale to ensure it does not jeopardise the delivery of services at the Oakhill Secure Training Centre. Given this is a G4S commercial undertaking the stage that their process is at and the identity of any preferred buyer that may be arrived at through that process are covered by contractual confidentiality considerations and the Ministry is unable to share this information.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether her Department carried out an impact assessment in the effect outsourcing repairs and maintenance in prisons to Carillion would have on the amount of work available to prisoners.,Owing to the variability of work available to prisoners across over 100 individual prison establishments it was not possible to undertake an impact assessment on the effect on the amount of work available to prisoners prior to the contracts being implemented. However we have ensured that the contract with Carillion requires them to maximise the use of prisoner labour subject to local security strategies agreed with the Governors for individual establishments. The specification for Prisoner Labour and Prison Industries in the contract requires Carillion to utilise as much prisoner labour in the delivery of services as was used prior to the contract coming into force. Under the maintenance contract Carillion are told how many prisoners are available for work on a daily basis and are required to provide the necessary support and supervision resource to oversee the work of the prisoners.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the potential merits of withdrawing Sodexo's prisons contract at HM Prison Northumberland as a result of the reports of mismanagement and understaffing at that prison.,These are extremely serious allegations which are being urgently investigated. The Justice Secretary has been clear that levels of violence and self-harm in our prisons are too high which is why we are investing an extra £100m annually to boost the frontline by 2500 officers. Every officer will be responsible for a case load of six offenders making sure all prisoners get the support needed to quit drugs and get the education and training that will help turn their lives around.These are long-standing issues which will not be resolved in weeks or months but we are determined to make our prisons places of safety and reform. <br> <br> We have robust processes in place to closely monitor and manage private contractors and will not hesitate to take action when standards fall short.

The Department has assured me that they have taken steps to rectify this including making further process improvements.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 15 February 2017 to Question 59530 if she will provide a breakdown of the £450000 cost of procurement activity for the supplier of the new electronic monitoring tags based on satellite tracking technology.,The £450000 cost to the Electronic Monitoring (EM) programme represents people resources engaged in the procurement of the next generation tags. These resources have been supplied by contractors to provide expert capability and capacity to strengthen accountability and governance during the Procurement exercise. This has helped ensure that the programme remains compliant with EU regulations meets legal obligations of fairness transparency and openness and provides confidence and assurance in the contract award decision.

The amount of time spent on corruption varied by region depending on local need and they have therefore not been included in the table above. From 2012 full-time regional corruption prevention managers were allocated to the Corruption Prevention unit and have been included in the above figures. In addition all prisons have an identified Local Corruption Prevention Manager (LCPM) and in some cases a deputy who develops intelligence raises awareness of corruption prevention and supports staff to report any corruption related concerns. This role is carried out in addition to other duties they may hold in a prison and so have not been included in the figures provided. The vast majority of staff undertake their duties with honesty and integrity. However the Prison Service is committed to investigating and eliminating corruption to ensure prisons remain a safe and secure environment for staff prisoners and visitors.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people have been given an immediate custodial sentence of less than six months in courts used by North Wales Police in North Wales by (a) gender and (b) offence in each year since 2010.,The number of adult offenders sentenced to immediate custody by gender offence category and court at all courts in the North Wales police force area can be viewed in the tables as follows:- <ul>Table 1 provides information for Mold Crown CourtTable 2 provides information for Wrexham Maelor Local Justice AreaTable 3 provides information for Flintshire Local Justice Area.Table 4 provides information for Denbighshire Local Justice AreaTable 5 provides information for Conwy Local Justice AreaTable 6 provides information for Ynys Mon (Anglesey) Local Justice AreaTable 7 provides information for Gwynedd Local Justice Area</ul> Magistrates courts data is reported by the Ministry of Justice by Local Justice area which can contain one or more magistrates courts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will list what mental health training courses are available to prison officers who are not Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork assessors after those officers have completed prison officer entry level training.,We are committed to making prisons places of safety and reform and giving prisoners the support and treatment they need to help turn their lives around. All prisons have established procedures in place to identify manage and help prisoners with mental health issues. Increased support is now available to those at risk of self-harm or suicide especially in the first 24 hours and we have invested in mental health awareness training for staff. All establishments provide The ÷Introduction to Mental Health which covers the factors which cause mental ill-health and the main types of disorders which offenders can display and ÷Introduction to Safer Custody course which are delivered locally for all prison officers. There is also a ÷Personality Disorder module within the ÷Introduction to Mental Health course and the ÷Introduction to Safer Custody course for Prison Officers which highlights the impact a personality disorder may have on an offender and how they can be supported. It also explains how to respond to challenging behaviour from an offender with this type of disorder. As part of the accredited Personality Disorder Knowledge and Understanding framework (PD-KUF) awareness level training is widely available to prison-based staff. Further non-accredited ÷Personality Disorder training is offered at prisons that host an Offender Personality Disorder treatment service. ÷Emotional and Mental Wellbeing training is delivered to officers who will be working in the Young Peoples Estate. This training outlines the factors which influence typical and atypical developments during adolescence and ensures learners can identify when an offender requires specialist support and referral. There is an ÷Enhanced Mental Health course which is run locally for Case Managers and Assessment Care in Custody Treatment (ACCT) Assessors only as they are the point of contact for an offender who is identified to be at risk. Within this training learners are taught to identify signs and symptoms for the various forms of mental ill-health how to manage the offender and when it is necessary to seek help from healthcare professionals. For note there are also a number of establishments who have worked with NHS trusts to commission bespoke mental health training
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many candidates (a) started and (b) did not complete prison officer entry level training in each year since 2010.,New joiner data is publicly available in the NOMS workforce statistics section on gov.uk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to tackle unduly lenient sentencing for animal cruelty offences.,Sentencing is a matter for the courts which are independent from government. When deciding what sentence to impose the courts take into account the circumstances of the offence and any mitigating and aggravating factors in line with the sentencing guidelines.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people convicted of human trafficking offences in the last three years have been returned to a country of origin (a) within the EU and (b) outside the EU to serve a prison sentence.,The information requested is not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Only main offences are recorded centrally so offenders may have human trafficking offences as secondary offences which could only be found by examining individual case files.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the Government plans to introduce a volunteering programme for ex-offenders.,Information and guidance to maximise the use of volunteers including ex-offenders and serving prisoners has been commissioned by the Ministry of Justice and was published in July 2016 by Clinks the umbrella group for voluntary organisations working with offenders and their families. The Department is committed to continuing and increasing the use of volunteers and encouraging appropriate volunteering opportunities for ex-offenders within rehabilitation services and elsewhere.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners participate in prison systems of (a) education (b) employment and (c) training; and what proportion of the prison population finds employment within six months of leaving prison.,"We know that prisoners who are in employment before or after custody are less likely to reoffend yet many offenders have little or no employment experience or marketable skills. We are currently looking at the work training and education in prison to ensure that provision prepares prisoners to enter meaningful employment on release so that they are able to make an effective contribution towards society and break the cycle of re-offending. In 2015/16 on average 11000 prisoners and detainees were working in custody at any one time across public sector prisons contracted-out prisons and Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs). They delivered 16 million hours of work during the course of the year. These figures relate solely to industrial work which is defined as work carried out in prison workshops (normally on the internal market commercial work or for other government departments). There are also significant numbers of prisoners in other learning vocational training or work opportunities within prison on tasks such as cooking serving meals maintenance and cleaning which can help them find a job on release and support their rehabilitation. The figures also exclude work placements undertaken by offenders on release from prison on temporary licence. The latest statistics relating to offender participation in education are published and can be found here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/further-education-and-skills-january-2017\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/further-education-and-skills-january-2017</a> Further data relating to offender education participation can be found here: <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/fe-data-library-further-education-and-skills\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/fe-data-library-further-education-and-skills</a> We currently do not record the proportion of prisoners in employment.

Ensuring that offenders gain the skills and qualifications inside prison to enable them to get jobs outside prison is a key part of our reform plans and we intend to launch an employment strategy later this year."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 15 February 2017 to Question 59530 what the reason for the time taken in answering that Question was.,The Ministry of Justice recognises that as a result of process and system changes we have experienced a recent reduction in performance with regard to QWA responses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the volume of drugs by type found in prisons was in each of the last seven years; and what proportion of that volume by type was brought into prison by (a) prisoners (b) visitors (c) drones or other external means and (d) staff.,"We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and take a zero tolerance approach to drugs in prisons. As the data shows we have found a significant amount of drugs in 2016. This demonstrates the effective work by our prison staff to disrupt the supply of drugs in our prisons. We have taken a number of actions to make sure that we can do so. We have: implemented an innovative new drug testing programme the first in the world to routinely test for psychoactive substances; trained over 300 drug detection dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances; made it a criminal offence to possess any psychoactive substance in a custodial institution; and proposed legislative change in the Prison &amp; Courts Bill to make it easier for prisons to test prisoners for emerging dangerous psychoactive substances. We have also taken swift action to stop the supply of drugs into our prisons equipping all prisons with portable and fixed detectors to tackle illicit use of phones in prisons. We are working with the police to catch and convict criminal using drones to smuggle contraband into prisons and testing physical and technological countermeasures to stop incursions.The information requested is only available from October 2015 onwards and is in the following table. An enhanced incident reporting standard was implemented in October 2015 that allowed the recording for weight of drugs found in an incident. As more than one type of drug can be found in an incident it is not possible to breakdown the weight for each type of drug found. Prior to October 2015 the system did not ask for the weight of drugs found to be recorded. Finds have increased between 2015 and 2016 this is likely due to better and more successful searching following these changes as well as an increase in the number of incidents of people attempting to bring drugs into prisons. <table><tbody><td colspan=\6\"">Incidents of drugs found in prisons by weight England and Wales October 2015 to December 2016      <td rowspan=\""2\"">Weight of drugs<td colspan=\""2\"">Number of incidents   2015<sup>1</sup>2016    9793577   2g to 5g4861956   6g to 10g164570   11g to 20g93354   21g to 30g72265   31g to 40g41119   41g to 50g22127   51g to 100g93348   101g to 200g60256   201g to 300g1190   301g to 400g1048   401g to 500g1345   501g to 1000g850   More than 1kg326   Unknown5332643   Total258810474                2015<sup>1</sup>2016   Estimated weight of drugs (kg)<sup>2</sup>46.9225.0               <td colspan=\""2\"">     <td colspan=\""3\""><table><tbody> </tbody></table>         <td colspan=\""3\"">    </tbody></table>(1) Data for 2015 covers October to December only(2) Estimated weight is calculated by summing the product of number incidents by the mid-weight of each weight category except for &quot;less than 1g&quot; and &quot;More than 1kg&quot; where it uses 1g and 1kg respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisons manage employment education and training systems; and at what standard those systems are running.,Education and training is available in all prisons in England. The majority of this is delivered by mainstream providers of further education and training complemented by some in house delivery.From April 2017 governors will be measured on the distance travelled in English and maths as well as rates of sustainable employment including apprenticeships and education in the period following release. To meet these new standards governors will at the same time be given the power to deliver change such as being able to design their regime to meet local delivery needs and target training and work in prisons to match the local labour market. Over 2017 and 2018 we will give governors control of the education budget so that they can overhaul education and training to match the skills and qualifications prisoners need in the local labour market.The provision is inspected by Ofsted at the invitation of HMIP using the same set of standards used to inspect mainstream further education.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to ensure that people with learning difficulties or disabilities are accommodated in available prison employment education or training systems.,The Government is committed to making prisons work so that offenders come out of prison better able to find work and support their families and less likely to reoffend.We have already taken steps to improve the support available to offenders with learning difficulties. NOMS in conjunction with Calderstones NHS Trust and a number of other partners are engaged in a project on learning difficulties and disabilities to improve outcomes for offenders both in custody and in community.In the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper we set out our plans to tailor educational input to suit the needs of the offender through a renewed focus on screening those offenders accessing prison education in order to identify learning difficulties or disabilities. Changing the way prisons are run creates an opportunity to refocus on offenders with learning difficulties and disabilities and how best they can be engaged with education in different types of prison environment. We will set out further details in the employment strategy that will be launched later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many phones and sim cards were recovered in prisons in each of the last seven years.,"The illicit use of mobile phones undermines the safety and security of prison. Which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action. Under measures introduced in late 2016 we can now apply for Telecommunications Restriction Orders at Court to block specific mobile phones being used in prisons. Since the legislation was introduced in August we have had more than 150 mobile phones cut off. In addition we have announced new measures in the Prison and Courts Bill that will allow the Secretary of State to authorise mobile network operators to block illicit mobile phone signals across entire prison sites. This will allow industry experts to work more creatively and effectively to block signals and means that we wont require a court order to stop the illicit and harmful use of mobile phones in prisons. Data on confiscated phones has been collated since April 2010 and the data requested for the period April 2010 to December 2014 has been provided in <a href=\http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2015-12-16/20343/\"" target=\""_blank\"">response to PQ 20343</a> answered on 11 January 2016. In 2015 there were 16987 finds in all prisons. One ÷find may constitute a handset containing one SIM card or media card a handset only a SIM card only or a media card or USB only. The figures used to provide this answer were drawn from live administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. The data are not subject to audit. An enhanced incident reporting standard was implemented in October 2015 that allowed better recording of the number of mobile phones and SIM cards found as well as other information relevant to the incident.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent steps her Department has taken to ensure that more prisoners leave prison with an identified employment education or training outcome.,The government is committed to ensuring that prisoners gain the skills and qualifications they need so that they come out of prison better able to find work better able to support their families and ready to turn their lives around.To ensure prisoners are prepared for life on release from April 2017 governors will be measured on the rates of sustainable employment including apprenticeships and education in the period following release.To help governors to meet the standards to reform offenders and prepare prisoners for life on release we are giving them freedom to design their regime to meet local delivery needs and target education training and work in prisons to match the skills and qualifications prisoners need in the local labour market. Over 2017 and 2018 we will give governors control of the education budget to enable this. Prisoners could also for example work shift patterns to deliver new commercial contracts.Progress made in maths and English will also be measured starting with qualifications gained from April 2017 and we are introducing testing on entry and exit in the longer term.In our Employment and Education Strategy which will be published later this year we will outline our plans to support prisoners in gaining the skills and experience they need to prepare them for employment on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of people charged with common assault have been granted bail before conviction in Magistrates' Courts in each of the last 10 years.,The proportion of offenders convicted at magistrates courts for offences of common assault and battery who were bailed prior to their conviction in England and Wales from 2005 to 2015 can be viewed in the table. Pre-conviction remand status information is not available for years prior to 2013.A breakdown of pre-conviction remand status for offenders convicted at magistrates courts prior to 2013 cannot be provided without disproportionate cost because the data held centrally for earlier years is estimated and cannot be used to separately identify pre-conviction remand status.Court proceedings data for 2016 are planned for publication in summer 2017.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many remand prisoners have been held in police stations until a prison place became available rather than returned to prison following a court appearance in the last 12 months.,Prisoners are only held in police custody following a court appearance in exceptional circumstances. For example when a court is sitting late and there is not enough time to return to their establishment. This practice has been in place since 2004.In order to establish how many are held on remand we would need to contact Prisoner Escort and Custody Services (PECS) contractors to review all prisoner records for those locked out to establish which ones were on remand as this is not held centrally and this could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to protect prison officers from the harmful effects of psychoactive substances used by prisoners.,We take a zero tolerance approach to drugs in prisons. Psychoactive substances present a variety of risks to our establishments not just to the individuals taking them but also to other prisoners and staff. We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and are already taking action on the supply and use of dangerous psychoactive substances by prisoners. We have developed an innovative new drug testing programme trained over 300 drug detection dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances and introduced new legislation which makes it a criminal offence to possess any psychoactive substance in a custodial institution. All prisons have robust risk assessments and control measures in place including local first aid and healthcare provisions. If staff suspect they have been exposed to drugs or psychoactive substances there are a range of support mechanisms available to them. This includes confidential counselling occupational health services and care-teams in prisons. Following any suspected exposure staff are also advised to visit the nearest Accident &amp; Emergency Department so that their symptoms can be treated and the appropriate medical advice can be received.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the effect of charges levied for a doctor's letter as evidence of domestic violence on the number of domestic violence claims; and if she will make a statement.,The Government is absolutely clear that victims of domestic violence must have access to the help that they need including access to legal aid. Legal aid is available for the purpose of obtaining urgent protection via the courts and this funding is not subject to evidence requirements. Legal aid is also available to those affected by domestic violence for private family matters such as child contact and financial arrangements following separation. In these cases objective evidence is required and a letter from a health professional which does not have to be a GP is one of the types of evidence that can be accepted. We are aware that a small number of GPs have been charging for this but we do not believe that there is a need to do so. In July to September of 2016 the number of applications for legal aid for private family matters in which evidence of domestic violence is required was 26% higher than the same quarter of the previous year and the proportion of applications granted has increased to over 75% in the last three quarters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the total pay bill was for (a) male and (b) female employees in her Department in 2015-16; and what the per capita spend from that pay bill for each man and woman was in that year.,"To provide the total pay bill by gender and the per capita spend for each man and woman for the 2015-16 financial year would incur disproportionate costs. Pay bill figures for men and women in each department can vary significantly based on representation at different grades and how many staff in the department are in full or part time work. A more meaningful way of considering existing pay disparities amongst men and women would be to look at each departments gender pay gap. The Civil Service has been publishing mean and median gender pay gaps for each department since 2008 as part of the annual release of Civil Service Statistics by the Office for National Statistics. The latest gender pay gap data (published in October earlier this year) can be found on the Office for National Statistics website: <a href=\https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/datasets/civilservicestatistics\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/datasets/civilservicestatistics</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many cases of breaches or failings of the Victims' Code have been received by her Department since 1 January 2017 by (a) text (b) tweet (c) e-mail and (d) letter.,We have made positive steps to improve the experience of victims to reduce unnecessary stress and lessen the emotional turmoil of attending court. But we have been clear that more must be done. We will set out our strategy for victims within 12 months and will bring forward any appropriate primary legislation. We are considering how compliance with the Victims Code might be improved and monitored. We are also exploring how those delivering services can be better held to account and are developing plans to engage victims and victims groups for their views. The Ministry of Justice has no facility to receive text messages. A record of tweets sent to Ministers can be viewed on their public profile. Since the beginning of the year there has been one letter from an MP whose constituents had concerns about the Code and wanted to share their experiences. We have also received by email a report from Voice4Victims.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what training is available for (a) police (b) probation staff and (c) Crown Prosecution Service staff on the nature of and compliance with the Victims' Code.,It is important that we make sure criminal justice agency staff are appropriately trained to deliver victims their rights.The College of Policing sets and maintains national learning standards to support and drive national consistency in honouring the commitments of the Police service to the Victims Code. However Forces are autonomous as to ÷how training is delivered and undertaken locally. The College recently re-launched the Victims Code electronic package available to all Police Officers and staff.Probation Service Officer and Probation Officer training includes e-learning about how victim issues and information should be addressed in parole reports and liaison between Victim Liaison Officers and Offender Managers in recall cases. Skills development training for Victim Liaison Officers was delivered between September 2014 and March 2016 focused on work with victims within the parameters of the Victim Contact Scheme.All CPS staff who attend court have been given a days worth of face to face training on the new Speaking to Witnesses at Court Guidance and how to interact with victims and witnesses at court without undermining the fairness of the trial. This is supported by a comprehensive package of e-learning which barristers who appear for the CPS in court are expected to complete. In addition all staff in CPS Victim Liaison Units are trained regarding timely and good quality communications to victims.We are considering how compliance with the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime (Victims Code) might be improved and monitored. Plans to engage with and obtain the views of victims and victims groups and criminal justice agencies are being developed
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners were given extra days in prison for assaulting a prison officer in each of the last three years.,I refer my Hon Friend to the answer given on 12 December 2016 to the Hon Member for Leeds [Written question Ò 56955]. Figures for 2016 are not yet available.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of trends in the number of prisoners temporarily released on resettlement overnight release licences in each of the last five years; and if she will make a statement.,Data on the number of prisoners released on temporary license (ROTL) of which resettlement overnight release is one type is published quarterly and data for each year going back to 2002 is published on gov.uk. We reviewed the approach to ROTL in 2013 to ensure risks are being managed effectively and there is now a greater focus on: linking the ROTL activity to the individuals sentence plan; countering any presumption to temporary release; and an improved risk assessment and management approach particularly with the most serious offenders. This has however had an unintended consequence Ò restrictions to improve risk management of the most serious offenders have resulted in lower risk offenders not being able to benefit from ROTL. We will maintain the improvements made while allowing governors greater discretion in how they tailor their ROTL regime to the circumstances of each offender. We know that three of the most powerful factors helping to keep ex-offenders from re-offending are a good job strong family ties and a stable place to live - ROTL makes all of them easier to achieve. Public protection is our top priority and we have no intention of changing the full risk-assessment offenders on ROTL must undergo and any non-compliance will be dealt with robustly.

It is concerned by the number of self-inflicted deaths and is committed to reducing it. The recent White Paper set out specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018. The National Offender Management Service is undertaking a suicide and self-harm reduction project led by an experienced prison governor which is driving work in this area. The work includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process the multi-disciplinary case management process that is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. This includes the roll out of new training that will help improve staff understanding of suicide and self-harm including a module designed to raise awareness of mental health issues and to equip staff to respond appropriately to prisoners experiencing mental health problems. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many probation staff employed by the Community Rehabilitation Company in Wales have (a) been offered and (b) accepted the enhanced voluntary redundancy scheme since the start of financial year 2015-16.,Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) are not contractually required to report on staffing numbers.

A thorough evaluation process was undertaken to assess the operational viability of this bid in the wider context of rehabilitation public protection and reducing reoffending and plans to realise efficiencies across the business. Nothing in the departments contracts with the CRCs owned by Working Links has changed as a result of the sale and due diligence investigations were carried out prior to the sale to make sure services will continue to be satisfactorily provided. The Working Links CRCs are continuing to provide services in accordance with their contracts and are being robustly managed by our contract management teams to make sure they fulfil their contractual obligations in relation to service delivery reducing reoffending protecting the public and providing value for money to the taxpayer.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many former prisoners have been employed as prison officers in each of the last five years.,We have not directly employed any prison officers with a custodial sentence in the last three years. We do not hold data prior to this.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate she has made of the number of prisoners who have been imprisoned over 100 miles from their home in England in the last 12 months; and if she will make a statement.,The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) seeks to hold prisoners in the most appropriate security conditions in prisons that are able to meet the need presented by their individual case at each stage of their time in custody. On 30 September 2016 there were 12678 prisoners with a recorded origin address in England held in prisons over 100 miles from their home address. The home address can include an address to which offenders intend to return on discharge or next of kin address. If no address is given an offenders committal court address is used as a proxy for the area in which they are resident and these figures are included in the answer. All data has been drawn from administrative IT systems which as with any large-scale recording system are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to ensure that familial relationships are maintained for prisoners that are transferred to prisons more than 100 miles away from their home; and if she will make a statement.,The White Paper on Prison Safety and Reform set out the importance of strengthening family ties which have a positive impact on a prisoners safety and wellbeing and maintaining links within the community. During induction any support required to maintain or establish family contact is identified. In some establishments family engagement workers support prisoners and their families to help this process. Family days are held at most prisons where the family can spend time together in as normal an environment as possible. The Assisted Prison Visits Scheme is available to support eligible people who are struggling to meet the costs of visiting someone in prison. The Secretary of State commissioned Lord Farmer to investigate how supporting men in prison in England and Wales to engage with their families can reduce reoffending and assist in addressing intergenerational crime as part of the reform agenda. The report of the Farmer review is due to be published in the Spring of 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the oral contribution of 24 January 2017 Official Report column 144 on prison staff if she will assess the effect of the reduction in accommodation fabric checks on (a) the incidence of self-harm and (b) maintaining order and security in prisons; and whether the outcomes set out in Prison Service Instruction 28/2011 and Prison Service Instruction 09/2016 have been achieved.,Prisons employ a range of operational security measures aimed at keeping prisons safe and secure. Accommodation Fabric Checks (AFCs) support this by disrupting the ability of prisoners to store prohibited items in their cells either for their own purposes or on behalf of others. Each prison must assess the frequency of AFCs required to meet their own security and safety needs. Any reduction in the frequency of AFCs may be more effectively offset by targeted and intelligence led searches. There is no direct link between the frequency of AFCs and self-harm. Other than through ensuring the integrity of the cell an AFC does not allow for any meaningful interaction between officer and prisoner. MoJ is investing an extra £100m annually to boost the frontline by 2500 prison officers so that every prisoner will have a dedicated officer to support them. Not only will a greater officer presence provide a deterrence to prisoner behaviour that threatens the safe running of prisons but officers will be better able to pick up on any signs of vulnerability in the prisoners assigned to them.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners took their own lives by using an upended unsecured bedframe as a ligature point in each of the last five years in (a) HMP Northumberland (b) private prisons (c) public sector prisons; if she will take steps to ensure that all bedframes in prisons are securely fixed; and if she will make a statement.,The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) records the methods used in self-inflicted deaths including ligature points. However the data do not show the precise way in which the ligature point was created. Since 2005 all new and refurbished cells have been built to the safer cell standard which minimises the availability of ligature points. This includes beds that are fixed in place and do not offer ligature points. In response to the recommendations of the review into self-inflicted deaths of young adult offenders conducted by Lord Harris the Government committed to continuous improvement in this design and to maintaining designated safer cells to the appropriate standard. We are clear however that designated safer cells must be seen as part of a wider care plan and can only complement and not replace a regime providing individualised and multi-disciplinary care for at-risk prisoners.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 6 December 2016 Official Report column 97 what progress has been made on using patrol dogs to reduce the frequency of drones bringing contraband items on to the prison estate in England and Wales; and if she will make a statement.,We remain vigilant to all incidents involving drones and take the threat they pose to prison security very seriously.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of literacy levels of prisoners in England and Wales in each of the last five years; and if she will make a statement.,The data requested is only available from August 2014 and shows for both the 2014/15 and 2015/16 Academic Years that fewer than half the people entering prisons have basic standards of English and around a third have identified learning difficulties. Prisons should be places of safety and reform and it is vital we use the time in prison productively. Having basic English and Maths skills helps people get jobs on release and helps them lead law abiding lives and I am determined to make sure that we achieve better outcomes for all prisoners. We will test offenders English and Maths skills on entry and as they leave prison and hold governors to account for these outcomes. We will use the results from the testing regime to create personalised learning objectives as part of the sentence plan. To support that we will introduce a core common curriculum and empower Governors to put in place a framework of incentives to encourage participation by those prisoners with poor literacy skills.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of trends in drug-related deaths of prisoners in England and Wales in each of the last five years; and if she will make a statement.,The number of drug-related deaths in prisons remains low.

The number of self-inflicted deaths is extremely concerning and we are committed to reducing it. Our recent White Paper set out specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018. We have taken immediate action to stabilise the estate by tackling the drugs drones and phones that undermine security.We have also provided an additional £10m of new annual funding for prison safety supplemented by £2.9m from existing budgets.

The 2016 data will be published on 27 April 2017.(b) In collecting information about self-harm incidents the National Offender Management Service does not attribute intent because it would be very difficult to do so with any degree of accuracy. Therefore the data does not distinguish incidents of attempted self-inflicted death.(c) Information on self-inflicted deaths by status is available for 2015 and 2016. This information can be combined with the published data on the prison population also available on gov.uk to calculate the relevant proportions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to reduce the incidence of suicide in prisons.,The Government believes that prisons should be places of safety and reform. As part of this reducing the incidence of suicide is a key priority. Our recent White Paper sets out the specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018. The National Offender Management Service has launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project led by an experienced prison governor which is driving work in this area. This includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process the multi-disciplinary case management process that is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. Providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are in distress and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify manage and support people at risk of suicide or self-harm. But we recognise that more can be done. That is why we have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers and allocated more funding for prison safety. These improvements and reforms will benefit prisoners who are vulnerable suffering from mental health problems or at risk of committing suicide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will make an assessment of the potential merits of exonerating rather than pardoning gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences; and if she will bring forward legislative proposals to exonerate gay and bisexual men of such offences.,It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today. Through pardons and the existing disregard process we will meet our manifesto commitment and put right these wrongs. Everyone living who obtains a pardon through the new process will also have obtained a disregard meaning that they will be treated as if they had never committed the offence.

There were 2 reported incidents in 2014 and 33 reported incidents in 2015. The Ministry of Justice intends to routinely publish information on prison drone incidents in the future and 2016 data will be provided in due course. We remain vigilant to all incidents involving drones and take the threat they pose to prison security very seriously. A range of methods to counter the threat posed by drones are being trialled and evaluated for their effectiveness across the prison estate. We have already introduced new legislation to further strengthen our powers making it illegal to land a drone in prison or to use a drone to drop in contraband. Anyone found using a drone in an attempt to get contraband into prisons can be punished with a sentence of up to two years imprisonment. We take a zero tolerance approach to smuggling of contraband into prisons and work closely with the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ensure those caught are prosecuted. Note: All figures have been drawn from live administrative data systems. Care is taken when processing and analysing the returns but the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps the Government is taking to incentivise employers to recruit ex-offenders.,We want prisons to be places of hard work and high ambition with incentives for prisoners to learn. We also want prison staff to prioritise education and employment opportunities. We are giving governors greater control over their budgets to bring in education and employment schemes that deliver real results. More private sector companies now employ ex-offenders than ever before but we are keen to increase the number of employers who can provide valuable vocational work for offenders in prison and who are able to offer them employment on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the Government's press release entitled Killer drivers to face life sentences published on 4 December 2016 if she will take further steps to improve the enforcement of offences related to dangerous driving.,On Monday 5 December we launched a consultation on offences and penalties relating to causing death and serious injury.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the Prison Reform Trust briefing Prison: the facts Summer 2016 what assessment the Government has made of the rate of self-harm among prisoners serving sentences for public protection; and what steps her Department is taking to reduce that rate.,The Government believes that prisons should be places of safety and reform and reducing self-harm is a key priority. Our recent White Paper sets out the specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018.The National Offender Management Service has launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project led by an experienced prison governor which is driving work in this area. This includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process which is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. ACCT is a multi-disciplinary case management process which includes support plans that reflect prisoners individual needs including any that are related to their progress through sentence.The Government is committed to making prisons safe. Reducing self-inflicted deaths is a key priority for the Government.As part of this providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are suffering and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify manage and support people with mental health issues or at risk of suicide or self-harm.But we recognise that more can be done. That is why we have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers allocated more funding for prison safety and have launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project to address the increase in self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in our prisons.These improvements and reforms will benefit any prisoner who is vulnerable suffering from a mental health problem or at risk of committing suicide Ò including a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP). Additionally to improve progression for all IPP prisoners we have set up a new unit within the Ministry of Justice are working with the Parole Board to enhance its capacity and so increase the efficiency of the parole process and finally providing better access to suitable interventions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many safer cells were built in prisons in England in each year since 2010; and how many existing prison cells were converted into safer cells in each such year.,Safer cells are designed to make an act of suicide or self-harm as difficult as possible. However no cell is totally safe and where a prisoner is accommodated in a safer cell this forms only a part of the package of support measures that are put in place to manage the risk of self-harm or suicide.Since 2010 all new prison accommodation has been built to safer cell standards. There is no central record of the number of cells that were converted into safer cells during this period.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many safer cells there are; and what proportion of prison cells are safer cells in each prison in England.,Safer cells are designed to make an act of suicide or self-harm as difficult as possible. However no cell is totally safe and where a prisoner is accommodated in a safer cell this forms only a part of the package of support measures that are put in place to manage the risk of self-harm or suicide.It is not possible to express the number of safer cells as a proportion of the total number of cells. This is because only those safer cells being used to accommodate prisoners who are being supported using the Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) case management process for prisoners at risk are operating as safer cells. The number of safer cells therefore varies over time. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of operational prisoner officers at each band have received mental health awareness training; what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of that training in reducing self-harm and suicides in prisons; and if she will make it her policy to ensure that all operational prison officers receive that training.,All new Prison Officers receive Mental Health Awareness training as part of their Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT).

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what training Community Rehabilitation Company staff receive on assessing the risk of harm and threat to the public from offenders on supervision.,Public protection is our priority and we continue to work closely with probation providers to maintain appropriate staffing levels and to rehabilitate offenders effectively. Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) and the National Probation Service are required to ensure that staff authorised as ÷Responsible Officers have the requisite skills to manage offenders and undertake relevant statutory functions including responding to and managing changes in an offenders behaviour that indicate the risk of serious harm is increasing. The ÷Probation Practice' competence framework outlines the minimum necessary skills an offender manager must demonstrate in order to be authorised as a ÷Responsible Officer. Training programmes provided or commissioned by the CRC in order to authorise staff as ÷Responsible Officers need to evidence how the programme aligns with these minimum criteria.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what sanctions are taken by her Department if either the National Probation Service or Community Rehabilitation Companies fail to take back to court offenders who have missed two or more appointments without reasonable excuse.,Protection of the public is our key priority. This includes taking effective action to ensure that court orders are properly enforced. Probation Instruction 06/2014 (Enforcement of Community Orders and Suspended Sentence Orders) requires the National Probation Service (NPS) and Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) to return offenders serving a community order or suspended sentence order to court in the event of two unreasonable failures to comply with the requirements of the order.NPS cases where action has not been taken within the timescales set out in the Probation Instruction are identified in management information reports and line managers are required to take appropriate action depending upon the circumstances of the case.The National Offender Management Services contract management teams closely monitor the CRCs to make sure they fulfil their contractual commitments to maintain service delivery reduce re-offending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer. This includes enforcing orders where offenders fail to comply.

We know that three of the most powerful factors helping to keep ex-offenders from re-offending are a good job strong family ties and a stable place to live - ROTL makes all of them easier to achieve. Public protection is our top priority and we have no intention of changing the full risk-assessment offenders on ROTL must undergo and any non-compliance will be dealt with robustly.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice on what date she plans to launch her Department's consultation on sentencing for dangerous driving.,The Government is committed to making sure that sentencing for those who kill or cause serious injury on the roads is proportionate within the context of our wider sentencing framework.We published the consultation on driving offences and penalties on 5 December.

In 10 of our most challenging prisons we have already started a recruitment programme and I am pleased to say that we have already made 348 job offers for those 400 jobs on top of 1400 new officer appointed in the last 12 months. To address the relatively higher numbers of new officers who leave in the first year we are improving the support that applicants and new prison officers receive so that they have the opportunity to explore and understand the role of the prison officer before applying and supporting them through to the completion of their training and probation. At 30 of our most challenging recruitment sites we will be giving prison governors greater freedoms to hire the staff right for them with the expertise and skills they need. In respect of established staff higher staffing levels are set to improve the supervision of prisoners operational resilience and staff engagement with prisoners; all of which will improve prison safety and encourage experienced staff to stay. The percentage of experienced staff is higher now than it was in 2010.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the timetable is for (a) recruitment and posting of the extra prison officers and (b) the special measures for vulnerable and mentally ill inmates announced in November 2016.,The Justice Secretary announced major reforms to the prison system in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper published on 3 November to cut reoffending and help reduce crime.To achieve this we are investing more than £100 million to boost the frontline with 2500 extra staff by the end of 2018. This will help drive forward our reforms to reduce violence improve standards and increase the staff to prisoner ratio. One of our first steps will be to invest an extra £14 million at 10 priority sites including HMP Berwyn in Wales which will pay for an extra 400 prison officers.Governors are critical to the successful delivery of safe prisons. That is why from April 2017 we are giving governors the power and budget to determine how their prisons are run. This includes governors having the authority to do their own workforce planning decide what staffing structures best meets their local needs and deciding how to deploy extra staff in prisons.With regards to special measures for vulnerable and mentally ill inmates it is vitally important that we provide the appropriate mental health care to prisoners to support their rehabilitation. That is why we are giving prison governors more say in delivering healthcare services in their prisons.As part of these reforms we will move to a joint approach to commissioning health services in England. Governors working closely with local health commissioners and clinical experts will be involved in the decision making process at each stage of the commissioning cycle. In Wales where health is a devolved matter we will liaise with the responsible Local Health Boards and the Welsh Government.All prisons have procedures in place to identify manage and support people who are at risk of harm to themselves.All new intake prison officers receive mental health awareness training as part of their entry level training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the number of offenders (a) breached and (b) who have their orders terminated for good progess affects the amount paid in a contractual year to a community rehabilitation company.,Community Rehabilitation Companies are measured on the proportion of offenders who successfully complete their Community Order or Suspended Sentence Order. The measure provides assurance that sentences are being delivered in their entirety and encourages CRCs to proactively work with offenders throughout to prevent them reoffending or breaching the order. If a CRC fails to meet the required performance we can require the CRC to pay a Service Credit to recompense for the minimum level of loss or damage as a result of a reduced provision of services. The application of Service Credits is a standard part of our contract management process. The number of offenders who have breached and not completed their Community Order or Suspended Sentence Order can result in a Service Credit being applied. Early completion of orders for good progress does not affect payment.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice to what extent contracts between her Department and community rehabilitation companies are dependent on offenders under supervision completing their orders.,Community Rehabilitation Companies are paid on the basis of volumes of offenders entering the system reducing reoffending and services provided for offenders not allocated to them. Performance metrics capture data and information on offenders completing their orders. Should they fail to meet the level required funds can be recovered to compensate for the reduced provision in service.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what information her Department holds on the average number of applicants received for prison officer vacancies.,A core part of our prison safety and reform plan is the recruitment of an additional 2500 additional prison officers. In 10 of our most challenging prisons we have already started a recruitment programme. I am pleased to say that we have already made over 300 job offers for those 400 jobs on top of 1400 new officers appointed in the last 12 months. The information requested is not held centrally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the (a) estimated number of offenders to be allocated to community rehabilitation companies and (b) actual number of offenders so referred have an effect on the overall contract price.,Community Rehabilitation Companies are paid according to the predicted volume of services they will be required to provide in a year. Payments are then adjusted at the end of the year to reflect actual volumes working within agreed contractual volume bands.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the number of offenders breached by a community rehabilitation company affects the total amount paid by her Department in a given financial year to that company.,Community Rehabilitation Companies are measured on the proportion of offenders who successfully complete their Community Order or Suspended Sentence Order. The measure provides assurance that sentences are being delivered in their entirety and encourages CRCs to proactively work with offenders throughout to prevent them reoffending or breaching the order. If a CRC fails to meet the required performance we can require the CRC to pay a Service Credit to recompense for the minimum level of loss or damage as a result of a reduced provision of services.

Early completion of orders for good progress does not affect payment.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent assessment she has made of the prevalence of the use of the psychoactive substance spice in prisons.,The emergence of psychoactive substances in our prisons has been a game changer. We take a zero tolerance approach drugs in prisons. In response to the growing use of dangerous psychoactive substances we have developed innovative new drug testing trained over 300 drug detection dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances and introduced new legislation which makes it a criminal offence to possess any psychoactive substance in a custodial institution. An important tool in assessing the use of drugs in prisons is via Random Mandatory Drug Testing (MDT). We introduced innovative testing for psychoactive substances as part of MDT in September this year. Data on use of psychoactive substances will be published alongside data for other drugs as part of official statistics next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to her oral contribution of 15 November 2016 Official Report column 127 on meetings with the Prison Officers Association what meeting she has (a) chaired and (b) attended with national representatives of the Prison Officers Association since 14 July 2016.,The Secretary of State has met with members of the Prison Officers Association (POA) National Executive Committee on three occasions since 14 July 2016. The meetings did not require a chair due to the small number of people in attendance. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to her oral contribution of 15 November 2016 Official Report column 130 on training dogs to detect new psychoactive substances how many such dogs have (a) been in service and (b) been trained to be in service in each year since 2010.,There are currently 312 Public Sector Prison dogs in service trained to detect new psychoactive substances. All 312 dogs were trained in 2015. No such dogs were trained before 2015.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to her oral contribution of 15 November 2016 Official Report column 131 what her policy is on the introduction of a programme to re-recruit prison officers who have recently left the service on temporary contracts.,We currently offer permanent flexible contracts to ex-prison officers under the HMPS Reserve Scheme which was established in November 2015. This was preceded by a Fixed-Term Contract project to recruit ex-officers which ran between 2014 and 2015.Under the HMPS Reserve Scheme we offer a permanent flexible contract to prison officers who have left voluntarily within the preceding 2 years. These staff will work flexibly to meet the needs of the estate. This helps to support the current operational workforce across the estate and to complement existing methods for meeting the staffing needs of prisons around the country.HMPS Reserve staff provide a valuable flexible resource for NOMS by supporting prison regimes. Former prison officers can also request to be re-employed. Under the Civil Service Commission Recruitment Principles we can re appoint those who have left within the last 5 years.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice on how many occasions during the last four years a serious further offence investigation involving probation services in England and Wales concluded that an offender had missed more than two appointments with those services without reasonable excuse; and on how many occasions the offender was not taken back to court as a result.,The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether data on numbers of offenders breached by a community rehabilitation company is given on request to the local police force.,All Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) have information sharing agreements in place with local police forces. CRCs would consider and respond to any request from the police for information about breaches of community sentences in line with the terms of these agreements.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will provide a breakdown of the proposed additional 2500 prison officers by prison.,We want our prisons to be places where staff and prisoners alike feel safe and secure. The introduction of new ways of working to support prisoners to reform will achieve this while also increasing frontline staff numbers. Prison governors will be empowered to determine the precise grade mix and deployment of staff into their establishment to meet the individual needs of their specific prisoner population in line with set minimum service requirements which are aligned to the NOMS Offender Management model. Staff numbers will vary across establishments dependant on prisoner population and type of prison.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the ratio of prisoners to prison officers was in each prison in England in each year from 2006.,The prison population by establishment and the number of prison officers (Band 3 Ò 5) for each public sector prison in England and Wales are published on gov.uk.As data are only published on staffing levels from June 2013 the attached spreadsheet provides staffing data as at March of each year for the period 2006 to 2013. Ratios can be calculated from these published figures.We are committed to transforming prisons into places of safety and reform and weve announced a major overhaul of the prison system including 2500 extra frontline officers.As an immediate action we have already invested £14 million to provide more than 400 extra staff in ten of the most challenging prisons. <br> <br> We are also introducing a new scheme to attract top graduates and former servicemen and women into the service and giving governors greater flexibility over recruitment so they can address staffing quickly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many drones carrying contraband goods have been seized within prison grounds in each of the last three years.,We remain vigilant to all incidents involving drones and take the threat they pose to prison security very seriously. A range of methods to counter the threat posed by drones are being trialled and evaluated for their effectiveness across the prison estate. There were no reported incidents of drones carrying contraband being seized within prisons in 2013; in 2014 there were 2 reported incidents; and in 2015 there were 11 reported incidents. The Ministry of Justice intends to routinely publish information on prison drone incidents in the future. Data for 2016 onwards will be provided in due course as part of the normal publication schedule.  Note: All figures have been drawn from live administrative data systems. Care is taken when processing and analysing the returns but the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to her oral contribution of 3 November 2016 Official Report column 1071 what the (a) remit (b) membership and (c) date of the last meeting is of the Government taskforce to address the issue of drone use and prisons.,We remain vigilant to all incidents involving drones and take the threat they pose to prison security very seriously. A range of methods to counter the threat posed by drones are being trialled and evaluated for their effectiveness across the prison estate. We have already introduced new legislation to further strengthen our powers making it illegal to land a drone in prison or to use a drone to drop in contraband. We take a zero tolerance approach to smuggling of contraband into prisons and work closely with the police and Crown Prosecution Service to ensure those caught are prosecuted. Anyone found using a drone in an attempt to get contraband into prisons can be punished with a sentence of up to two years imprisonment. However I want to do more specifically by setting up a government taskforce to challenge industry to help in this crucial area with Ministerial colleagues in the Department for Transport Home Office Department for Culture Media and Sport and Ministry of Defence. We will work with drone manufacturers to challenge them to do more to stop the illegal use of drones in prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether supervision for an offender who is subject to two or more community orders or parole licences in the same or different areas is undertaken by one or more offender managers.,An offender who is subject to two or more community orders in the same or different areas is supervised by one offender manager. Prisoners serving more than one custodial sentence in England &amp; Wales will be issued with one licence upon release and therefore would be supervised by one offender manager.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the contents or findings of a Serious Further Offence review involving probation services in England and Wales are (a) given to or (b) discussed with the victim or victim's family; and if she will make a statement.,In any case where an offender is convicted of a serious further offence (SFO) it is vital that the victim of that SFO is assured that the agencies involved in supervising the offender are committed to identifying whether there are any lessons to be learned for the supervision of other offenders. Further a Victim Summary Report (VSR) is produced in any mandatory SFO review to be shared upon conviction with the victim(s) of the SFO and/or their family. The VSR is a summary of the full SFO review in narrative form and presents to the victims of the SFO(s) in an accessible format an account of the supervising agencys work with an offender. The main findings of the SFO review including any lessons learnt are pulled together and written in a report specifically with victims in mind including with clear explanations. A senior representative of the supervising agency (NPS or CRC) will also meet the victim which allows the victim to ask questions and provides the basis for the supervising agency to account for its actions and where there were shortcomings to explain how it intends to improve its practice.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether the number of offenders who have breached and subsequently not completed their community orders affects level payments made by the Department to the company responsible for those orders.,One of the performance measures for Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) is the proportion of offenders who completed their community sentence successfully. This means that an offender did not reoffend or breach their order throughout the whole sentence. The measure provides assurance that sentences are being delivered in their entirety. If a CRC fails to meet the required performance for a performance measure we can require the CRC to pay a Service Credit. These are a pre-estimate of the minimum level of loss or damage as a result of a reduced provision of services by CRCs. The application of Service Credits is a standard part of our robust contract management process. So whilst the number of offenders who have breached and not completed their community order does not affect the payments made to the company directly it can result in a Service Credit being applied.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what information her Department holds on whether any community rehabilitation companies in England or Wales are using or plan to use virtual supervision in undertaking the supervision of offenders.,The owners of the Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) provided their proposed operating models as part of their bid; these models were carefully scrutinised before contracts were awarded. CRCs are now in the process of implementing their new operating models. Probation officers will continue to maintain oversight of offenders through face to face meetings and telephone contact. We are aware that some CRCs plan to use new technology to extend their supervision options including through use of Skype and biometric kiosks. We will continue to robustly manage the CRC contracts to make sure they deliver their contractual requirements protect the public reduce reoffending and provide value for money for taxpayers.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will investigate the failure of the prisoner transport constructor GeoAmey to deliver three defendants to Plymouth Crown Court on 28 October 2016; and what the cost to the public purse was of that failure.,This incident has been investigated and the Contractor GEOAmey has accepted they failed to deliver one of the defendants by the time ordered by the Judge. The Judges Order was overlooked and instead arrangements were made to deliver that particular defendant to court at the time usually expected under the Contract based on the distance from the prison where they were held to the court. The other two defendants were delivered to court on time in line with contractual arrangements. Liquidated damages are a standard tariff applied to all contractors as a genuine pre-estimate of probable loss based on the cost of delay to the court and which are applied incrementally according to the amount of time delayed. The liquidated damages incurred for the delay to Plymouth Crown Court on 28 October are £2094.75 and will be paid by GEOAmey as required under the Contract.

We are committed to meeting the mental health needs of prisoners. All prisons have procedures in place to identify manage and support people with mental health issues. Too many prisoners currently go on to reoffend - almost half of all prisoners are reconvicted within a year of release. The cost of reoffending by former prisoners is estimated to be up to £15 billion a year. To tackle this we are embarking on the most far-reaching prison reforms for a generation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps are being taken to ensure appropriate sentencing for people convicted of attacks and assaults on police and all front line emergency officers.,Offenders who assault police and other front line emergency officers rightly face more severe sentences because the victim is providing a service to the public. In all such crimes the fact that the victim is providing a service to the public is treated as an aggravating factor meaning that sentences for assaulting front line emergency officers will be more severe. In addition there are specific offences relating to attacking police officers and prison officers acting as constables. The offence of assault on a police constable - where little or no injury is caused Ò is the equivalent of common assault and has a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment. Sentencing guidelines which are issued by the independent Sentencing Council recognise that assault on a constable is more serious than common assault because the victim was assaulted in the line of duty. There is also an offence of assault on a police officer when attempting to resist arrest which has a maximum penalty of 2 years. Where the injuries to the victim are more serious more severe offences will be charged such as ABH and GBH which have higher maximum penalties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness the Government's policy on reintegrating prisoners into society.,It is vital that offenders are successfully reintegrated into communities if they are to turn their backs on crime and become productive members of society. Through-the-gate resettlement services delivered by Community Rehabilitation Companies mean that virtually all prisoners have access to targeted support to help them find accommodation and employment on release and advice on finance benefits and debt. To make sure that probation services are delivering improved outcomes for offenders and communities we are conducting a comprehensive review of the probation system. Prisons also have a vital part to play in preparing offenders for life after release and close partnership working between prisons and probation is essential in making sure offenders are supported to reintegrate into society. Last week we set out our plans for prison safety and reform in order that custody better prepares offenders to lead law-abiding lives after release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to improve resettlement activity at HM Prison Littlehey.,We are committed to helping offenders turn their lives around and to reducing reoffending.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 24 October 2016 to Question 48562 what the sentence length of each of the 61 people convicted of murder was; and at what point in that sentence those people were released on temporary licence during Christmas 2015.,In 60 of the cases mentioned in the reply to Question 48562 the offender is serving a sentence of life imprisonment which means they must serve a minimum period or tariff in prison and may be released on life licence on or after the expiry of the tariff only where the Parole Board assesses that it is safe to do so. In 36 of these cases the offender was beyond the tariff expiry date before being temporarily released last Christmas. In 24 cases the release took place within a 24 month period leading up to the tariff expiry date. Allowing temporary release before tariff expiry in suitable cases where the offender is making good progress ensures that the offender can be prepared for release when this is considered by the Parole Board.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what rehabilitation programmes are provided for people serving prison sentences of 12 months or less.,Prisons should be places of safety and reform. We are determined to make prisons work so that offenders come out of prison better able to find work and support their families and less likely to reoffend.Those serving sentences of under 12 months in custody have access to education; work; offending behaviour programmes; health services including help with drugs or alcohol problems; and resettlement support in custody and into the community. Our reforms to probation services mean that for the first time in recent history they also receive statutory support and supervision on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether her Department plans to undertake a full review of sentencing guidelines.,Sentencing Guidelines are issued by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales a body independent of Government.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when she plans that a review of Through the Gate provision for offenders serving 12 months or less will begin; and when she plans to present the findings of that review.,As with any major transition of public services we continually evaluate and review how those changes are operating to support the achievement of our objectives. Public protection is our top priority and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action to make sure our vital Transforming Rehabilitation reforms are being delivered to reduce reoffending cut crime and prevent future victims.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisons are facilitating the Government's Through the Gate provision for offenders serving 12 months or less.,As a result of the reforms to probation services for the first time adult offenders serving under 12 months in custody can access the Through the Gate resettlement service in prison and into the community. To support this unprecedented resettlement service we established a network of 89 Resettlement Prisons to facilitate the transition from custody into the community to enable the Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) to work with those prisoners returning to their local area. The contracts with CRCs also provide for such services even where a prisoner has not been transferred to a designated resettlement prison prior to release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment her Department has made of the levels of the use of (a) illegal drugs and (b) legal highs in prisons in the UK in each of the last 5 years.,Prisons should be places of safety and reform. The increase in psychoactive substances in prisons has contributed to a rise in prison violence making offenders more volatile and their reactions more difficult to judge and manage. Improving safety and decreasing violence is an urgent priority for the Government.We have introduced legislation to restrict the supply and possession of psychoactive substances in prisons and put in place new penalties for possession of a psychoactive substance in custody. Following a successful trial in 34 prisons over the summer we have introduced an innovative new programme of mandatory drug testing for psychoactive substances in all prisons.Mandatory Drug Testing (MDT) figures for prisons in England and Wales are published by financial year on gov.uk. MDT for psychoactive substances began in September 2016 and figures will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the relationship between the use of (a) illegal drugs and (b) legal high in prisons and incidents of violence against prison staff.,Prisons should be places of safety and reform. Improving safety and decreasing violence is an urgent priority for the Government.The increase in psychoactive substances in prisons has contributed to a rise in prison violence making offenders more volatile and their reactions more difficult to judge and manage.We have introduced legislation to restrict the supply and possession of psychoactive substances in prisons and put in place new penalties for possession of a psychoactive substance in custody.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to increase the number of people rehabilitated in UK prisons.,The government is committed to making prisons in England and Wales places of safety and reform.We have already taken steps to reform the prison estate to make it more efficient safer and focused on supporting offenders coming out of prison to be better able to find work better able to support their families and less likely to re-offend. We have invested £10m of new funding to support governors in improving prison safety are investing a further £14 million to provide more than 400 extra staff in in ten prisons to allow staff more time to supervise and support prisoners. Alongside that we have established six Reform Prisons to trial what significantly greater freedoms for governors can achieve. We are investing £1.3bn to reform and modernise the prison estate.We will set out full details of our plan for prison safety and reform in a White Paper in the coming weeks.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the contractual agreement between her Department and G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited at HM Prison (a) Birmingham and (b) Oakwood how many performance points have been incurred and for what reason those performance points have been incurred in each year from 2012-13 to date.,"Well-run prisons are fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. Private providers play an important role in the prison estate. Performance of all providers is closely monitored and we will not hesitate to take action where standards fall short.Prison Contracts set out a strict performance framework consisting of prescriptive performance targets. Failure by the provider to meet performance targets results in performance points being applied.Performance points are awarded according to the severity of failure. If the total number of points exceeds the agreed baseline for the performance quarter or year financial remedies are applied against the Contractor in accordance with the Contract. In certain circumstances financial remedies can also be applied directly without performance points being accrued. The amount of points awarded therefore cannot always be linked to the value of remedies imposed.The number of performance points incurred at HMP Birmingham and HMP Oakwood for the reporting years 2012-2013 through to 2015-2016 are as follows.Data for reporting year 2016-2017 is not yet available as it has not been finalised.<table><tbody>  2012-20132013-20142014-20152015-2016  PointsPointsPointsPoints<td rowspan=\3\"">Birmingham<em>Failure to comply with procedures</em><em>0</em>248.925103<em>Incidents</em><em>0</em>000<em>Failure to comply with prison regime</em><em>135</em>45.7100<td rowspan=\""3\"">Oakwood<em>Failure to comply with procedures</em><em>7</em>1.500<em>Incidents</em><em>0</em>000<em>Failure to comply with prison regime</em><em>90</em>1000</tbody></table>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the contractual agreement between her Department and G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited at HM Prison (a) Birmingham and (b) Oakwood for what reason financial remedies have been levied in (i) failure to comply with procedures (ii) incidents and (iii) failure to comply with prison regime in each year from 2012-13 to date.,Privately Managed prison contracts contain provisions which allow financial remedies to be applied for non-performance. Performance points are awarded according to the severity of failure. If the total number of points exceeds the agreed baseline for the performance quarter or year financial remedies are applied against the Contractor in accordance with the Contract. As financial remedies are only applied if baseline targets are exceeded it is not possible to link individual incidents to the value of remedies that have been applied due to this cumulative effect.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (a) how many and (b) what proportion of prisoners released on licence to a bail hostel have been subsequently recalled to prison in 2016 to date.,Between January 2016 and March 2016 (the latest date for which figures are available) 715 offenders were recalled to prison whilst residing in an approved premises. We are unable to give an accurate figure for the proportion of departures from an approved premises that were attributable to the offender being recalled to custody. This is because some residents of an approved premises are not offenders released from custody on licence; in terms of departures these cannot be distinguished from other residents. Approved premises provide for effective supervision of certain high risk of harm offenders particularly on release from custody. It would not be possible to provide such effective supervision elsewhere in the community which is the only alternative for offenders who have completed the custodial part of their sentence. Offenders who breach their licence conditions (including the rules of residence of an approved premises in which they are required to reside) are liable to be recalled to custody in order to protect the public.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (a) how many and (b) what proportion of people released from each prison in England and Wales (i) reoffended and (ii) went into employment within six months of their release in each of the last five years.,Information on the employment status of prisoners beyond the point of release is not available centrally and can only be obtained at a disproportionate cost. All other information requested can be found on GOV.UK.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department has taken to ensure first-time offenders entering the prison system are (a) made aware of gang culture in prisons and (b) discouraged from becoming involved in that culture.,Safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. We do not tolerate violence or bullying in prisons and take appropriate action against victimisation of any kind. Gang membership and youth violence cause serious harm to those involved and their communities. The Government is committed to reducing the likelihood of young people joining gangs and to responding effectively when they do. Many young and vulnerable people come into contact with the criminal justice system as a result of their involvement with gangs. Prison gives young people the opportunity to leave gangs behind and lead safe and productive lives in their communities. Prison staff work with the police to tackle gang related activity in prison and to provide new opportunities for young people.All offenders entering prison participate in induction programmes designed to help them make the most from their time in that prison. Some prisons have appointed a gangs officer and prison staff work closely with the police to respond where gang members are coming into prison. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) will shortly issue guidance to all prison staff to help them identify gang members take action against gang related violence and help them use their time in prison to leave gangs behind. The Identity Matters programme is specifically designed to help prisoners disengage from gangs and stop offending.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many arrest warrants have been issued for people sentenced for a serious sexual offence who failed to appear in court for sentencing in each year since 2010.,Data on Failure to Appear (FTA) warrants collected by the Ministry of Justice includes information on the category of warrant but does not include information on the specific offence for which the defendant is being sought. This information has been provided in response to Parliamentary Question 47082.It would not be possible to separately identify those defendants for whom a warrant was issued in connection with failing to appear in court for a sexual offence without incurring disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people were prosecuted in their absence for (a) serious sexual offences (b) class A drug use and (c) manslaughter in each year since 2010.,Information on whether or not a defendant is in attendance at their hearing is not held centrally and can only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners are serving indefinite sentences in England.,Data on indeterminate sentence prisoners (both those serving life and Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentences) are routinely published as part of the Offender management statistics quarterly bulletin and can be found on GOV.UK.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners serving indefinite sentences in England are awaiting re-offending courses.,On 11<sup>th</sup> October 2016 there were 215 indeterminate sentence prisoners on the referral list for the Healthy Sex Programme and 115 for the Extended Sexual Offending Treatment Programme in England and Wales. All other NOMS accredited offending behaviour programmes are managed locally and data on waiting lists is not held centrally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether all European funding for schemes to improve the employability of prisoners has been protected for the duration of their funding period.,As the Chancellor set out on 13 August all structural and investment fund projects signed before the Autumn Statement will be fully funded even when these projects continue beyond the UKs departure from the EU.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many drones have been intercepted operating over prisons in England and Wales (a) in 2015 and (b) from January 2016 to date.,There were 33 incidents relating to drones reported by prisons in 2015. This includes finds interceptions and sightings of drones in and around prisons in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice intends to routinely publish information on prison drone incidents in the future and 2016 data will be provided in due course as part of the publication schedule. We remain vigilant to all incidents involving drones and take the threat they pose to prison security very seriously. A range of methods to counter the threat posed by drones are being trialled and evaluated for their effectiveness across the prison estate. We have already introduced new legislation to further strengthen our powers making it illegal to land a drone in prison or to use a drone to drop in contraband. Anyone found using a drone in an attempt to get contraband into prisons can be punished with a sentence of up to two years imprisonment. We take a zero tolerance approach to smuggling of contraband into prisons and work closely with the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ensure those caught are prosecuted. Note: All figures have been drawn from live administrative data systems. Care is taken when processing and analysing the returns but the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what prisons and security-related sales and services the UK is (a) contracted to provide and (b) planning to provide to other countries in (i) 2017 (ii) 2018 and (iii) 2019.,As has been announced previously we want the Ministry of Justice to focus firmly on its domestic reform programmes. NOMS continues to be committed to supporting international cross government priorities but does not provide commercial services to other jurisdictions and has no plans to do so in the future. The National Offender Management Service can provide foreign jurisdictions access to a range of information covered by Crown Copyright including accredited programmes and related assessments and training where there is no or minimal impact upon resources. This material is delivered in return for a fee under a licence agreement. The fee is charged on the basis of cost recovery only.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she is taking to expand education in prisons to reduce reoffending rates and improve life chances for offenders returning to their communities.,Prisons should be places of safety and reform. I am determined to make sure that we achieve better outcomes for prisoners in employment education and health. Fewer than half the people entering prisons have basic standards of English and Maths and around a third have identified learning difficulties or disabilities. This is a huge problem because we know that low levels of education can prevent people from securing jobs on release and leading law abiding lives. On 15 September the Prime Minister announced the transfer of adult prison education in England to the Ministry of Justice from the Department for Education from 1 October. I would like to see governors having more responsibility for delivering education and being held to account for the outcomes prisoners achieve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (a) how many and (b) what proportion of (i) men and (ii) women were refused bail and remanded in custody before conviction when the allegation related to (A) an offence against the person (B) a public order offence (C) a harassment offence and (D) a sexual offence in the latest period for which figures are available.,The Bail Act 1976 creates a presumption in favour of bail. The main reasons for refusing bail are that the defendant is accused of an imprisonable offence and the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant if released on bail would abscond commit further offences while on bail or interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. In deciding whether or not to grant bail the court will consider a number of factors including: the nature and seriousness of the crime; the character of the defendant; his past criminal record; associations and ties with the community; the defendants record in regard to his previous commitments to bail conditions; and the strength of evidence against the defendant.The number and proportion of offenders remanded in custody before conviction for violence against the person public order offences harassment or sexual offences by gender at magistrates courts and the Crown Court in England and Wales in 2015 can be viewed in the attached table.Court proceedings data for 2016 will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to educate prisoners nearing release so that they are able better to reintegrate into society.,Prisons should be places of safety and reform. I am determined to make sure that we achieve better outcomes for prisoners in employment education and health. Fewer than half the people entering prisons have basic standards of literacy and numeracy. This is a huge problem because we know that low levels of education can prevent people from securing jobs on release and leading law abiding lives. I want to see much clearer accountability for prison governors for the education delivered whilst prisoners are in prison and the results they achieve to get significant improvement.

These two sets of data are not directly comparable due to the impact of the Offender Rehabilitation Act (ORA) 2014. Prior to the enactment of ORA 2014 any offenders sentenced to under 12 months imprisonment would not have fallen within scope as they would not have been subject to probation supervision. It is important to note that not all offenders charged will result in the conviction for a SFO.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will review entry to employment in the National Probation Service to (a) enable more public sector staff to access the vacancies in that service and (b) ensure that the previous public sector experience of new applicants is recognised with regard to their terms and conditions.,Public sector civil servants and those public servants working for accredited Non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPB) have access to vacancies in the National Probation Service (NPS) after they have been advertised to surplus civil servants Vacancies are open to all employees from across the Civil Service regardless of grade or department.Arrangements are in place to recognise existing terms and conditions if someone in the wider Civil Service is successful in obtaining a job in the NPS.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the total cost to the public purse of prison officer recruitment was in each quarter since June 2013.,The recruitment of prison officers involves a number of internal and external parties that all contribute towards the overall process. The cost to the public purse of prison officer recruitment is not held centrally by The National Offender Management Service and it can only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if she will bring forward proposals to bring prison officers' retirement age into line with that of staff in the police force fire service and armed forces.,Like other Civil Servants and the wider workforce Prison Officers can now choose to retire at their State Pension Age (SPA) should they wish to do so unless they have a protected lower pension age allowing them to retire at age 55 60 or 65.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans she has to open new prisons.,We have a big issue with prisons that are out of date and not fit for purpose which makes it more difficult for our excellent governors and officers to manage them well. We have a £1.3 billion building programme. I want new modern prisons to be built in which prisoners will get the education and work they need to succeed in outside life and to close down some of our most dilapidated and out of date prisons. HM Prison Berwyn a modern 2106 place prison in Wrexham will open in 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many people have been sentenced to a term in prison for (a) non-payment of council tax (b) watching television broadcasts without a television licence and (c) tax evasion in each year from 2008-09 to 2014-15.,"The law and penalties in these three areas are different. The Government takes tax evasion very seriously. There is no single definition of Ïtax evasion so there are several offences under which those who evade taxes can be prosecuted with a maximum penalty of up to 7 years for the most serious cases under c) below. Watching television broadcasts without a television licence is also a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of a fine. Non-payment of council tax is not a criminal offence. Where a person fails to pay the council tax after it has been demanded the local authority may apply to the magistrates court for a liability order. Liability orders are granted for the amount owed plus reasonable costs. If they are still not paid the local authority can apply for a warrant committing an individual to prison; an individual cannot be fined for non-payment of council tax. a) The number of people imprisoned following non-payment of council tax in England and Wales by financial year from 2009/10 to 2014/15 can be viewed in table 1. The magistrates courts have been using their centralised case management system since early 2009 so data are only available from 2009/10.b) Immediate custody is not an available sentence for TV licence evasion; the maximum sentence is a fine.c) The number of offenders sentenced to immediate custody at all courts for offences relating to tax evasion in England &amp; Wales by financial year from 2008/09 to 2014/15 can be viewed in table 2.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the adequacy of support available to prison officers experiencing mental illness.,The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to ensuring the health safety and wellbeing of its staff. An employees GP retains primary responsibility for the care and treatment of mental health problems. NOMS recognises its duty of care to staff and provides wide ranging occupational health services fast tracking to psychological interventions (where clinically indicated for ill-health due to work related trauma) and offers comprehensive employee assistance (EAP) services which are available 24 hours a day 365 days a year in support. Staff are also able to self-refer for counselling by calling a 24 hour helpline in complete confidentiality. A well-established system of Care Teams also exists which provide the social and practical support for staff in the early days following a serious incident. Innovations and support locally are continually under review and enhanced wherever possible. Assessment of the adequacy of support is ongoing at all levels Ò locally regionally and nationally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if her Department will make an assessment of the potential merits of increasing the number of offenders on probation housed in Approved Premises.,Approved Premises (formerly known as probation or bail hostels) are used to provide enhanced supervision for higher-risk offenders who have been released from prison after completing the custodial part of their sentence. They also house a small number of defendants on bail. My Department is analysing the capacity and distribution of the Approved Premises estate to establish whether more places are needed.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many (a) Approved Premises have been operational and (b) people have resided in each of those premises in each year since 2010.,100 Approved Premises have been operational since 2010. Figures on the number of individuals who have resided in each of the Approved Premises are not held centrally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what advice her Department provides to people living in Approved Premises who have (a) an addiction (b) a mental health condition and (c) other health conditions.,Offenders required to reside in Approved Premises are entitled to the same health provision as ordinary members of the public.Approved Premises staff are not medically qualified and so cannot give clinical advice. They do have a general duty of care and Approved Premises staff are trained in identifying and working with people with addictions or mental health problems. All residents are obliged to be registered with a GP and many Approved Premises have arranged provision such as on-site GP attendance and run healthy living programmes.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prisoners serving a mandatory life sentence have been released early from prison in each of the last 10 years.,A life sentence is mandatory for murder. A life sentence must also be imposed for a second very serious specified violent or sexual offence Ò for example manslaughter GBH with intent rape and sexual assault on a child under 13 - unless the court finds that there are particular circumstances relating to the offence or the offender which would make it unjust to do so. Under a life sentence the offender must serve the full minimum term imposed by the court before being considered for release on life licence by the Parole Board which will only release an offender if and when it considers it safe to do so. Where a whole life order is imposed the offender is not eligible for parole. The number of life sentences imposed in each of the last ten years can be found on gov.uk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what additional resources were made available to prisons to accommodate the increased number of people recalled to custody following the introduction of the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014.,The Offender Rehabilitation Act was a key piece of legislation under the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme that extended statutory rehabilitation to offenders who served short sentences. Time spent on licence is an integral part of a custodial sentence. It is right that all offenders under probation supervision are subject to strict monitoring. In some cases offenders are recalled if their behaviour is causing concern to prevent a further offence from being committed. In order to enable prisons to deliver the requirements of the act the National Offender Management Service reviewed resources within each prison establishment Offender Management Units that received remand prisoners. Following this review additional roles were introduced across prison establishments to support the increased casework processes.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate she has made of the cost of recalling 22412 people to custody over the last 12 months.,There are several agencies involved in recalling and returning offenders to custody. The information requested is not held centrally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to reduce the level of drugs in prisons.,The Justice Secretary is clear that safety is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. There are a number of factors including the availability of drugs in prisons which must be tackled in order to make our prisons safe and places of rehabilitation. We have introduced tough new laws which will see those who smuggle packages over prison walls including new psychoactive substances face up to two years in prison. Those who involve themselves in the distribution of drugs in our prisons should know that they could face prosecution and extra time behind bars. We have a range of security measures and searching techniques in place to detect drugs and to prevent smuggling into prisons. I am looking closely at this important issue and will be setting our further plans in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps she plans to take in response to the most recent HM Inspectorate of Prisons report on HMP Chelmsford; and if she will make a statement.,HM Inspectorate of Prisons report on HMP Chelmsford was published on 16 August this year. We take all recommendations made by the Chief Inspector seriously and the prison is taking action to address the Chief Inspectors findings. We will produce a detailed action plan within three months responding to all the recommendations in the report. The action plan will be published on the Inspectorates web site.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what progress has been made on the rehabilitation of offenders with Imprisonment for Public Protection sentences since 2012.,Offenders serving sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) continue to be detained beyond their tariff where the independent Parole Board determines that the level of risk of harm and re-offending which they pose is too great to be safely managed in the community. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) continues to prioritise IPP offenders for courses and provides other interventions to help them reduce their risk.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps the Government is taking to improve education in prisons.,Education is key to helping prisoners turn their lives around and in particular to securing employment which we know reduces reoffending. We realise that many prisoners have led challenging lives and may have missed out on the opportunity to learn. For example nearly one third struggle with learning difficulties or disabilities and only a quarter enter employment on release. Dame Sally Coates was asked to lead an independent review of education in prisons. This was published on 18th May 2016 and we have accepted in principle all the recommendations made.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps the Government is taking to ensure that offenders find employment on release.,Supporting offenders into meaningful employment is a vital aspect of our approach towards ensuring that those who have committed a crime provide an effective contribution towards society and break the cycle of re-offending. Most offenders arrive in prison with very low levels of educational attainment very high levels of substance misuse and often no or very poor histories of employment. Working with our Community Rehabilitation Companies we seek to tackle each of those issues via a variety of interventions to equip people with the basic foundations to allow them to secure and hold down a job on release.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the effect of recent reduction in staff numbers in prisons on (a) prisoners' access to education and (b) prisoners' access to recreational activities.,As the Justice Secretary said in the House on 6 September the retention of staff is a very important issue and we are stepping up our recruitment efforts. Prison officers and teachers are vital in turning around offenders and getting them the education and skills they need to succeed outside. Our prison officers are doing a fantastic job getting prisoners into education.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department is taking to tackle access to and use of psychoactive substances in prisons.,The Justice Secretary is clear that safety is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. There are a number of factors including the availability of psychoactive substances in prisons which must be tackled in order to make our prisons safe and places of rehabilitation. We have introduced tough new laws which will see those who smuggle packages over prison walls including new psychoactive substances face up to two years in prison. Those who involve themselves in the distribution of drugs in our prisons should know that they could face prosecution and extra time behind bars. We have a comprehensive range of security measures and searching techniques in place to detect drugs and to prevent smuggling into prisons.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the causes of recent increases in violent incidents towards staff in prisons; and what steps she plans to take to reduce such incidents.,The level of violence in our prisons is unacceptable. I am clear that safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. There are a number of factors including the availability of psychoactive substances in prisons which must be tackled. It will take time to address there long-standing problems. I am determined to make sure our prisons are safe and places of rehabilitation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what steps her Department has taken to reduce the incidence of self-harm in prisons.,The Government is committed to reducing the incidence of self-harm in prisons. All prisons are required to have procedures in place to identify manage and support people who are at risk of harm to themselves. These include the Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process which is a prisoner-centred flexible care planning system for prisoners identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm. An additional £10m of new funding supplemented by £2.9m from existing budgets was recently allocated to the 69 prisons with the most concerning levels of violence and self-harm. The Justice Secretary is clear that safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment she has made of the performance of (a) the National Probation Service and (b) community rehabilitation companies in placing ex-offenders into employment in (i) Norfolk and (ii) England.,We assess the performance of the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) through a range of service levels and for CRCs through a robust contract management and assurance process. Performance information against these service levels is published quarterly but it does not include an assessment of performance in placing offenders into employment. We have however introduced enhanced measures of resettlement which include the recording of employment at the start and end of the sentence and at the end of the licence supervision period for any offender. We aim to include this in future publications for both CRCs and the National Probation Service once data collection has bedded in. We closely monitor and robustly manage providers to make sure they fulfil their commitments to maintain service delivery reduce reoffending protect the public and provide value for money to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average tariff given with a mandatory life sentence was in each of the last 10 years.,"A life sentence is mandatory for murder and the courts must follow statutory guidance on determining the minimum term or tariff in these cases. A life sentence must be imposed for a second very serious specified violent or sexual offence Ò for example manslaughter GBH with intent rape and sexual assault on a child under 13 - unless the court finds that there are particular circumstances relating to the offence or the offender which would make it unjust to do so. Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for our independent judiciary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what her plans are for prison reform.,I am committed to continuing the vital work of prison reform. We need to create safe secure and purposeful prisons with regimes that help rehabilitate offenders so there are fewer victims in the future. This a key part of the Governments commitment to delivering social justice for all. We already have an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate improve education and empower governors so that we can tackle issues like drugs and violence which are key to cutting reoffending and keeping staff and prisoners safe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many women supervised by community rehabilitation companies (CRC) following a prison sentence of less than 12 months have been recalled to prison in each (a) CRC area and (b) month since February 2015.,"Anyone who breaches his licence conditions is liable to be recalled to custody. Those who commit a crime while on licence face prosecution and potentially more time in prison. For serious offences they can be held in prison on remand until trial.The figures provided in the tables below refer to offenders serving a sentence of less than 12 months who have been released and subsequently recalled. These offenders became subject to supervision and licence conditions only as a result of the commencement of the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 (ORA) in February 2015. Prior to this such offenders were released unconditionally.Throughout the period covered by the data the number of offenders subject to the new provisions has steadily increased. This is because the ORA requirement applied only to those sentenced after commencement. In recent months the number of ORA offenders being recalled has levelled out.Furthermore the ORA provisions have had a disproportionate effect on the number of women recalled because evidence suggests women are more likely to receive shorter sentences.Table A gives a breakdown of the number of men and women supervised by Community Rehabilitation Companies following a prison sentence of less than 12 months who have been recalled to prison each month since February 2015.Table A<table><tbody><td colspan=\10\"">Number of offenders recalled from licence following a sentence of less than 12 months by gender month and Community Rehabilitation Company area               Feb-15Mar-15Apr-15May-15Jun-15Jul-15Aug-15Sep-15Oct-15Nov-15Dec-15Females                       Community Rehabilitation Companies212182538494545483848London145555351196Derbyshire Nottinghamshire Leicestershire &amp; Rutland00333278843Staffordshire &amp; West Midlands03211526343Warwickshire &amp; West Mercia00004242315Durham Tees Valley00001010010Humberside Lincolnshire &amp; North Yorkshire01011112100Northumbria00002300202South Yorkshire00001534144West Yorkshire01210012010Cheshire &amp; Greater Manchester00152322102Cumbria &amp; Lancashire00000021000Merseyside00003221302Bedfordshire Northamptonshire Cambridgeshire &amp; Hertfordshire00002122211Essex00021011011Kent Surrey &amp; Sussex00012263666Norfolk &amp; Suffolk01002110300Bristol Gloucestershire Somerset &amp; Wiltshire00210211324Dorset Devon &amp; Cornwall10010531002Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight00101420113Thames Valley00214211001Wales02033403033            Males                       Community Rehabilitation Companies560158268310393323338422387380London013174653395139746765Derbyshire Nottinghamshire Leicestershire &amp; Rutland01182430403529362330Staffordshire &amp; West Midlands095139202416162529Warwickshire &amp; West Mercia0010761238121710Durham Tees Valley000471345032Humberside Lincolnshire &amp; North Yorkshire0041515241219241131Northumbria0203554610103South Yorkshire0161218171122223424West Yorkshire0061510677979Cheshire &amp; Greater Manchester17262644482839353434Cumbria &amp; Lancashire004598131171110Merseyside01598206102097Bedfordshire Northamptonshire Cambridgeshire &amp; Hertfordshire0681213221717282210Essex004445551292Kent Surrey &amp; Sussex0481224272228282516Norfolk &amp; Suffolk013856866813Bristol Gloucestershire Somerset &amp; Wiltshire125167171519141120Dorset Devon &amp; Cornwall07988161412151112Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight10234268642Thames Valley2337481012191113Wales03151927382820293538            </tbody></table>Table B gives a breakdown of women supervised by Community Rehabilitation Companies following a prison sentence of less than 12 months who have been recalled broken down by the number of times they have been recalled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment her Department has made of the implications for (a) prison officer and (b) prisoner safety of prison officers working in shifts at other prison establishments in addition to those prison establishments at which they are based.,There is a requirement that home/parent establishments maintain records of all official duties carried out by members of staff both those duties within their home/parent establishment and within or for any other establishment. Establishments are also required to maintain records when members of staff from other establishments carryout duties within or for their establishment.Individual members of staff have a responsibility to support the above and are required inform their parent establishment of their wish/intention to work additional hours at another establishment in advance of the hours being worked.When members of staff are deployed to another establishment for a protracted period on Detached Duty they are given an appropriate induction to familiarise them with specifics of the prison and key issues relating to individual prisoners. If standard duties are carried out on an ad hoc basis for other establishments standard risk assessments and briefs will be carried out.In all circumstances records should be maintained.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many women supervised by community rehabilitation companies following a prison sentence of less than 12 months have been recalled to prison during their licence period (a) once (b) twice (c) three times (d) four times and (e) five or more times.,"Anyone who breaches his licence conditions is liable to be recalled to custody. Those who commit a crime while on licence face prosecution and potentially more time in prison. For serious offences they can be held in prison on remand until trial.The figures provided in the tables below refer to offenders serving a sentence of less than 12 months who have been released and subsequently recalled. These offenders became subject to supervision and licence conditions only as a result of the commencement of the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 (ORA) in February 2015. Prior to this such offenders were released unconditionally.Throughout the period covered by the data the number of offenders subject to the new provisions has steadily increased.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many breach proceedings initiated by community rehabilitation companies the National Probation Service has rejected; and what the reasons for those rejections were.,It has not been possible to answer this question in the time allowed. I will write to the honourable member in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what information her Department holds on the number of prison officers who work additional shifts at other prison establishments; and whether line managers at those prison officers' main place of work are aware of additional shifts worked elsewhere.,There is a requirement that home/parent establishments maintain records of all official duties carried out by members of staff both those duties within their home/parent establishment and within or for any other establishment.Establishments are also required to maintain records when members of staff from other establishments carryout duties within or for their establishment.Individual members of staff have a responsibility to support the above and are required inform their parent establishment of their wish/intention to work additional hours at another establishment in advance of the hours being worked. In all circumstances records should be maintained.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what representations she has received on prison officers working additional shifts in other prison establishments than those at which they are based without the knowledge of their line management.,Following an audit of the arrangements under which members of staff undertake additional hours/shifts new arrangements and requirements were introduced that mandated the need to maintain records of all attendance arrangements both those within parent establishments and also any additional attendance within other establishments.The above new arrangements were introduced in 2014 with the publication of Notice to Staff 43/2014.Concerns have previously been raised relating to staff undertaking additional hours/shifts within establishments other than their home/parent establishment by the Prison Officers Association. It is felt that the introduction of the above addresss this as the arrangements ensure that information is readily available to managers to enable them to monitor the additional attendance.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of breach proceedings initiated by community rehabilitation companies resulted in a person being recalled to prison by the National Probation Service in each of the last two years.,The National Probation Service does not authorise recall requests on behalf of the Secretary of State. Therefore we have interpreted your question relating to breach proceedings in relation to those cases where a Community Rehabilitation Company is seeking an endorsement of a recall request by the National Probation Service before it is submitted for authorisation. This applies to cases where there is evidence of an increase in the offenders risk of serious harm to high and the risk is not deemed to be imminent. We do not hold this information centrally and therefore it is not possible to provide you with the information which you have requested.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many secondary schools use cashless payment systems for school meals.,"Cashless payment systems can have a number of advantages including better queue management removing issues around pursuing payment and reducing potential stigma for those claiming free school meals. However it is for governing boards to decide the best system for collecting payment for school lunches and the department does not collect data on how many schools use such systems. The department has produced non-statutory guidance for schools on biometric systems in general available at the following link: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268649/biometrics_advice_revised_12_12_2012.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268649/biometrics_advice_revised_12_12_2012.pdf</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much has been paid in Payment Plus to prison officer grades in each prison establishment since January 2016.,"A core part of our prison safety and reform plan is the recruitment of an additional 2500 additional prison officers. In 10 of our most challenging prisons we have already started a recruitment programme. I am pleased to say that we have already made 280 job offers for those 400 jobs on top of 1400 new officers appointed in the last 12 months.The information requested is shown in the tables below.

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many hours were worked in Payment Plus by prison officer grades in each prison establishment since January 2016.,"A core part of our prison safety and reform plan is the recruitment of an additional 2500 additional prison officers. In 10 of our most challenging prisons we have already started a recruitment programme. I am pleased to say that we have already made 280 job offers for those 400 jobs on top of 1400 new officers appointed in the last 12 months.The information requested is shown in the tables below.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will provide emergency funding to academies in Gloucestershire while the review of education funding is pending to cover additional costs associated with changes in the level of (a) teachers' pay (b) national insurance contributions and (c) pension costs; and if she will make a statement.,We remain committed to introducing a national funding formula from 2017 so that schools can start benefitting from fairer funding as soon as possible. This reform will mean the money the Government is investing in education is better matched to need and that school leaders have more certainty about their funding over the longer term. As well as making funding fairer we are supporting schools with tools and guidance to improve their financial health so they can manage their budgets effectively and keep driving up standards. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many (a) childcare places are available for three and four year olds and (b) eligible children there are in (i) England and (ii) Copeland constituency.,"The latest statistics providing the number of three and four year old children benefitting from some funded early education provision can be found online within Table 2LA at:<a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/education-provision-children-under-5-years-of-age-january-2016\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/education-provision-children-under-5-years-of-age-january-2016</a> Figures are available at national and local authority level. Information at constituency level is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. All three and four year old children are entitled to a funded early education place. The proportion benefitting is calculated using population estimates[1] derived from mid-year estimates and projections provided by the Office for National Statistics. As at December 2015 the estimated number of three and four year old children in England was 1412500 and in Cumbria local authority was 10300. The proportion of three and four year old children in receipt of some funded early education provision can be found online within Table 5LA at the link above. Figures are available at national and local authority level. Information at constituency level is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. [1] Population estimates at lower geographic levels such as local authority are subject to a greater degree of error. In some cases local authority take-up rates can exceed 100%. Therefore take-up rates at local authority level should be treated with more caution than national take-up rates. """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education when her Department expects to confirm to childcare providers the rates to be paid to them when delivering 30 hours free childcare per week for three and four year olds.,We have already announced increased annual investment of £1 billion for the early years entitlements within the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant by 2019-20 which includes £300 million per year from 2017-18 to uplift the average funding rate paid to providers. The increase to the funding rate is based on robust evidence from the Review of the Cost of Childcare. We have made clear our commitment to maximise the amount of this funding which reaches frontline childcare providers and will consult on proposals for achieving this as part of our consultation on early years funding reform later this year. Local authorities in consultation with their Schools Forum are responsible for deciding how best to distribute the early years entitlement funding across their locality. They also set their own local rates of funding for their early years providers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the ability of childcare providers in (a) England and (b) Copeland constituency to provide the additional hours necessary to extend free childcare for three and four year olds.,"The Government is committed to delivering on its manifesto commitment to extend the current free childcare entitlement for working parents of three-and four-year-olds from 15 to 30 hours per week. We are working with local authorities and the childcare sector and providing the support that providers will need to offer the extended entitlement from September 2017. The Department recently completed the most comprehensive analysis of the childcare market to understand the funding that providers will need to deliver the extended entitlement. The review of childcare costs was published in November 2015 and can be viewed here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479659/151124_Analytical_review_FINAL_VERSION.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479659/151124_Analytical_review_FINAL_VERSION.pdf</a>. The review informed the increase in the funding rate to providers that was announced in Novembers Spending Review. We will be investing an extra £1 billion per year in the free early years entitlements by 2019/20 including £300 million per year to increase the national average funding rate. This is a generous deal for providers and funds them adequately for delivering the entitlement. The childcare sector has shown its ability to meet increased demand; Laing and Buissons 2014 nursery market report estimated that the UK childrens day care market is now almost one third larger than it was a decade ago. To support continued growth the Department is investing at least £50 million of capital funding to create additional early years places and we are removing unnecessary red tape to enable providers to seek investment to expand their businesses. The recently launched capital grants fund will support the delivery of the 30 hours extended entitlement coming into effect from September 2017. Funding of around £40 million is being made available to early years settings including schools through a local authority bidding process. Cumbria County Council submitted an EOI in relation to the early years capital funding and providers in Copeland are therefore eligible to apply to the current funding process. We will expect local authorities to work in close partnership with providers when submitting their bids to ensure that the projects submitted have a clear need for capital funding and are able to fully evidence how they will address the sufficiency need identified in the local authority area."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department plans to publish a response to the finding of the National Union of Teachers survey published in March 2016 that 70 per cent of school leaders believed that a lack of school funding was affecting education standards in their schools.,Funding for education is a priority for this government. As announced at the Spending Review we have protected the core schools budget in real terms. This year the schools budget will total around £40 billion. We are also committed to making funding fairer by introducing a national funding formula. A national funding formula will ensure that all schools are on an even starting point from which to build educational excellence. This is because a national funding formula will recognise pupil need and pupils with similar needs will attract the same amount of funding wherever they are in the country.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the level of funding for secondary schools per pupil was in each of the last six years; and if she will make a statement.,"Funding for local authorities is primarily allocated through the Dedicated Schools Grant as a single guaranteed (schools block/early year block) unit of funding per pupil.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what real-terms funding she has allocated to schools in Birmingham for each of the next five years.,Nationally we have protected the core schools budget in real terms to the end of the current Spending Review period enabling a per-pupil protection for the dedicated schools grant so that the money available for our schools will increase as pupil numbers rise.The DSG allocations for Birmingham in 2016-17 are found in the table below:Birmingham DSG allocations 2016-17<table><tbody>2016-17 Schools Block Unit of Funding (SBUF) (£)2016-17 Schools Block (£million)5218.42888.62</tbody></table>Allocations for future years will be announced in due course.We believe that schools should be funded on a consistent and predictable basis which is why we have proposed to introduce a National Funding Formula. The first stage of our two part consultation closed on 17 April and we are currently considering all the responses. We will be launching the second stage of the consultation which will include illustrative allocations for all schools and local areas later in the year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if her Department will take steps to increase funding of post-16 performing arts education and training.,We believe that post-16 education plays a crucial role in helping young people realise their potential. Thats why we announced as part of the Spending Review that we will protect the national base rate of £4000 per student for the duration of the parliament. In addition vocational performing arts programmes receive a 20% uplift reflecting the extra costs of delivering these courses.The government also remains committed to supporting talented students through the Dance and Drama Awards scheme. Around 1300 young people and adults each year receive financial help through the scheme to gain high level vocational training in dance drama and musical theatre.In addition the Department for Education provides means-tested support through the Music and Dance Scheme to ensure that talented children from all backgrounds are able to receive the world-class training they need to succeed in careers in music and dance.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 14 January 2016 to Question 21530 how many serving prisoners were not in prison on 25 December 2015; what offences were committed by each such offender; and how many such offences were in which category of violent offences against the person.,"Public protection is our priority. All offenders must meet strict criteria and pass a full-risk assessment before being considered for Release on temporary licence (ROTL). ROTL is used to prepare prisoners for their eventual release from custody and helps them build and maintain family ties which is proven to help reduce reoffending. Consideration will therefore be given to allowing eligible prisoners to take ROTL that coincides with family celebrations and religious holidays of particular significance including Christmas. The number of failures of temporary release in 2015 fell by 32% to 162. The failure rate at 49 per 100000 releases is the lowest since 2002.Records indicate that on 25 December 2015 973 prisoners were in the community having been released on temporary licence (ROTL). The table below shows the principal offence for which these prisoners were serving a sentence by offence category and within the Ïviolence against the person category by offence.  <table><tbody><td colspan=\3\"">Table: Prisoners on temporary release on 25 December 2015 England &amp; Wales    NumberPercentage of total number releasedPrisoners on temporary release on 25 December 2015973<em>100%</em>  <em> </em>Violence against the person200<em>21%</em>Murder61<em>6%</em>Attempted murder5<em>1%</em>Kidnapping4<em>0%</em>Threats to kill*<em>-</em>Manslaughter12<em>1%</em>Causing death or serious injury by dangerous driving10<em>1%</em>Causing death by careless driving under influence of drink or drugs4<em>0%</em>Causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving*<em>-</em>Assault with intent to cause serious harm84<em>9%</em>Endangering life7<em>1%</em>Harassment*<em>-</em>Assault with injury6<em>1%</em>Racially or religiously aggravated assault with injury*<em>-</em>Sexual offences10<em>1%</em>Robbery66<em>7%</em>Theft offences86<em>9%</em>Criminal damage and arson7<em>1%</em>Drug offences441<em>45%</em>Possession of weapons32<em>3%</em>Public order offences*<em>-</em>Miscellaneous crimes against society48<em>5%</em>Fraud offences79<em>8%</em>Summary non-motoring*<em>-</em>  <em> </em>   <td colspan=\""3\"">An asterisk (*) has been used to suppress values of two or less.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to improve the capacity of schools and colleges to support children and young persons who are experiencing mental illness.,"Children and young peoples mental health is a priority for the Department. We have high aspirations for all children and young people and we want them to be able to fulfil their potential. Good mental health is core to them achieving that outcome. To help children and young people maintain good mental health and access support when they need it we provide a range of information tools and guidance to enable schools and colleges to provide appropriate direct support for their pupils and to work collaboratively with health services and other providers.When diagnosable mental health problems occur schools and colleges need to be able to refer pupils to specialist support from Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHS) voluntary organisations and local GPs. To improve coordination between services the Department for Education and NHS England have run a joint £3m pilot between schools and CAMHS in 255 schools across 27 Clinical Commissioning Groups. This pilot aimed to improve knowledge and understanding of mental health issues develop and maintain effective joint working practices and to test the concept of having a 'single point of contact' in both schools and CAMHS. The outcomes from the pilot are being independently evaluated and a full report is expected by the end of this year with early findings very positive. We are currently working on plans to both extend the reach of the pilots and scale up activity in existing areas.We have published a blueprint for school counselling services which provides schools with practical evidence-based advice informed by schools and by counselling experts on how to deliver high quality school-based counselling to support those pupils with particular needs: <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools</a>To help teachers to identify those pupils who need help we have issued advice on behaviour and mental health[1]. In addition we funded the PSHE Association (Personal Social Health and Economic Education)[2] to provide mental health guidance and lesson plans which support age-appropriate teaching dealing with emotions and helping teachers to talk to children about their anxieties and worries.Whilst not an alternative to professional interventions peer support programmes have the potential to provide effective additional support for pupils facing anxiety issues or other concerns. We are looking at encouraging the provision of quality peer support in schools and colleges community groups and online. We have announced £1.5m of funding for this work and are currently reviewing the findings from a national call for evidence.[1] <a href=\""http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a>[2] <a href=\""http://www.pshe-association.org.uk/\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.pshe-association.org.uk</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much her Department spent in the last five years on the provision of English language teachers for students recently arrived in the UK with little knowledge of that language.,The department distributes school funding to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant. Each local authority then devises a formula through which it allocates funding to schools in its locality. No funding is allocated on the basis of pupils who have recently arrived from overseas either from central government to local authorities or from local authorities to individual schools.Local authorities can include an ÷English as an additional language (EAL) factor in their funding formulae. EAL funding is determined on the basis of census data which records whether or not a pupils first language is English. Funding allocated through this factor forms part of the schools core budget and it is for school leaders to determine how best to use their whole budget so that all pupils can reach their full potential.We will introduce a national funding formula from 2017-18 so that funding is fair and matched to need. Our first consultation proposed that the formula should include an EAL factor. We will set out the precise detail of the formula in our second consultation.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the number of children in (a) Bradford South constituency and (b) Yorkshire and the Humber who do not meet the expected levels of speech and communication skills in the Early Years Foundation Stage assessment.,The Government wants all children regardless of their background to have access to high quality early education and childcare as we know this is what makes the difference to outcomes. To help close the gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers we introduced the two-year-old entitlement of 15 hours of free early education in September 2013. Already 70% of two-year-olds are benefitting from the free early education entitlement. We have also invested over £50 million in the Early Years Pupil Premium to further help disadvantaged children in the early years.While the Department does not carry out analysis at constituency level on the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Profile results information at Bradford local authority level shows a significant increase in the proportion of children reaching the expected level in communication and language. The most recent EYFS Profile results show that the gap has narrowed:<ul>For Bradford local authority: 78.3% in 2015 compared to 71.2% in 2014 and 66.6% in 2013; andFor the Yorkshire and Humberside region: 79.5% in 2015 compared to 75.7% in 2014 and 69.9% in 2013.</ul>The national picture shows a similar trend with the gap narrowing to 80.3% in 2015 from 77.1% in 2014 and 72.2% in 2013.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to ensure that all 18 year olds leaving school have the skills to prepare a high quality CV.,"The Department publishes statutory guidance (for schools which sets a clear framework for the provision of careers advice and guidance. The guidance which is available at <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440795/Careers_Guidance_Schools_Guidance.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440795/Careers_Guidance_Schools_Guidance.pdf</a> sets out how every school should engage with local employers and professionals to ensure real-world connections are in place to prepare young people for working life. These activities could include speakers from the world of work mentoring workplace visits or help with basic career management skills like CV writing. The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company (CEC) continues to make excellent progress. Its Enterprise Adviser Network is brokering links between schools colleges and employers in 36 Local Enterprise Partnership areas; with 60 Enterprise Coordinators and 400 Enterprise Advisers working with schools and colleges to support their careers and enterprise provision. In March 2016 The CEC announced 33 successful bidders to its £5m careers and enterprise fund. This £5m investment from government will boost provision for nearly 250000 young people across England in 75% of the areas the company has identified as ÷cold spots. In addition the company is working to create a new generation of high-quality mentors to help teenagers fulfil their potential."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will estimate the cost of providing free school meals to children of people in receipt of universal credit upon the full roll-out of that benefit; and what the cost was of the provision of such free school meals to children of people in receipt of benefits prior to the roll-out of universal credit.,We will continue to ensure that children from the poorest families benefit from a free school meal. My Department is continuing to work closely with the Department for Work and Pensions to consider eligibility criteria for free school meals following the introduction of Universal Credit. In the meantime any child in a family in receipt of Universal Credit will continue to be entitled to free school meals.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department plans to adjust the pupil premium funding for schools to take account of the additional responsibilities proposed in the Children and Social Work Bill in its current form.,The Children and Social Work Bill proposes a new duty on schools to appoint a designated teacher to promote the educational achievement of previously looked after children. The pupil premium plus is additional funding for schools to support the educational needs of looked-after children and those who were previously looked after but who have left care through an adoption Special Guardianship or Child Arrangements Order. The Spending Review confirmed that the pupil premium will be protected at current rates over the course of this Parliament. This protection applies to the pupil premium plus which will continue at £1900 per pupil. Pupil premium plus funding for pupils who were previously looked after is allocated directly to schools and it is for the head teacher to decide how best to use it to support the needs of these pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much funding for children and young people with special educational needs was allocated to East Sussex local authority area through the dedicated schools grant in each of the last three years.,Funding for children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) is allocated to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which includes both funding to be delegated to mainstream schools and funding for the additional costs associated with educating children and young people with high needs. The Department does not allocate specific amounts of funding for children and young people with SEN within the funding allocated to local authorities for their mainstream schools. Schools are funded through a formula set by their local authority and local authorities are required to delegate funds to a level that enables schools to meet the additional costs of pupils with SEN up to £6000 per annum. For those pupils whose additional support costs more than £6000 the local authority pays top-up funding to the schools from their high needs budget. East Sussex County Councils high needs allocation within the dedicated schools grant in each of the last three years was as follows:2015-16: £44.06 million2014-15: £42.82 million2013-14: £40.94 million
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy that any children who would have been entitled to free school meals under the previous system retain that entitlement under the new eligibility criteria under universal credit.,We will continue to ensure that children from the poorest families benefit from a free school meal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education when her Department plans to publish the findings from areas piloting 30 hours of free childcare.,We are currently commissioning the evaluation of early implementation of 30 hours free childcare. An invitation to tender was published in May 2016 with a view to awarding the contract to a successful bidder by the end of June 2016. The evaluation will focus on generating learning that can be used by Early Implementers and all local councils ahead of national implementation in September 2017.
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much was levied in respect of financial remedies in each key performance indicator designated in respect of the contractual agreement between his Department and G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited at HM Prison Birmingham in each year since 2011.,Well-run prisons are fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. Private providers play an important role in the prison estate. Performance of all providers is closely monitored and we will not hesitate to take action where standards fall short. All private prisons are managed by a full-time on-site controller. Where a provider fails to meet the expected level of performance financial remedies can be applied. This ensures that providers are incentivised to properly support the rehabilitation of offenders through a safe decent and secure regime. The attached table provides a breakdown of financial remedies applied for both HMP Birmingham and HMP Oakwood (HMP Featherstone II was the working name during construction of HMP Oakwood). No financial remedies were applied at either prison in 2011/12. Operation of HMP Birmingham transferred from HM Prison Service to G4S Justice Services in October 2011. HMP Oakwood opened in April 2012.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to increase the number of qualified early years teachers in nurseries.,The department delivers early years initial teacher training places through the National College for Teaching and Leadership. There are four training routes available: undergraduate assessment only graduate entry and graduate employment based. To encourage take up the Department funds course fees pays bursaries to eligible trainees on the graduate entry route and provides financial support to employers for those trainees on the graduate employment based route. As part of our thinking on the early years workforce strategy we will be considering how best to continue to grow the graduate workforce including supporting improved career progression. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment she has made of the level of affordability of childcare.,"The Government uses a range of information from a number of different sources to consider the affordability of childcare including: our ÷Childcare and early years survey of parents (<a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013</a>) independent surveys such as the Family and Childcare Trust Annual Childcare Cost Surveys (<a href=\""http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015</a>) and the recent House of Lords Select Committees report on affordable childcare Ò to which we responded on 17 December 2015 (<a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-childcare-response-to-the-select-committee-report\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-childcare-response-to-the-select-committee-report</a>). We are committed to supporting hard-working parents with the costs of childcare and to make it more affordable. That is why we will be investing an extra £1 billion per annum by 2019-20 to help hardworking families with the cost of childcare. Since 2008 nursery costs have been increasing well above inflation but the latest survey from the Family and Childcare Trust suggests that the nursery costs of childcare in England for both under and over two-year-olds have remained largely flat across all settings in the last year. We are already funding 15 hours a week of free early education for all three- and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds Ò this saves families around £2500 per child per year. From September 2017 we will go further delivering an additional 15 hours of free childcare for the working parents of three- and four-year olds (with early implementation in some areas from September 2016) Ò worth around another £2500 per child per year. We also continue to invest in the Early Years Pupil Premium. We are also introducing Tax-Free Childcare from early 2017 under which around 2 million families could benefit by up to £2000 per child per year or £4000 per child per year if a child is disabled. For working parents on low and middle incomes working tax credit pays up to 70% of their childcare costs and as of April 2016 this has increased to 85% under Universal Credit. This support will be available for the first time to those working fewer than 16 hours per week."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she has taken to implement the provision of 15 additional hours of free childcare for working parents provided for under the Childcare Act 2016.,"At the 2015 Spending Review the Government announced that we would provide £300 million for a significant uplift to the rate paid for the free childcare entitlements for two- three- and four-year-olds from 2017-18. Together with the funding announced at last summers Budget we will be investing over £1 billion more per year by 2019-20 to fund our commitments on the entitlements. The Childcare Act which provides the legal framework for the extended entitlement received Royal Assent in March. We also announced in February the eight early implementer local authorities which will offer the extended free childcare entitlement from September 2016. This means around 5000 children will be able to benefit from 30 hours of high-quality free childcare places a year earlier than planned. The Department is also consulting on key elements of the operation and delivery of the extended free entitlement. This includes how the entitlement will be delivered and how it will meet and be responsive to the needs of working parents. To date we have received over 1000 responses from a wide range of childcare providers local authorities and provider organisations. We will use these views to inform our thinking as we move to delivering the 30 hours policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether the per pupil fee for the planned introduction of 30 hours free childcare  will be the same for each local authority.,At the Spending Review we announced the average funding rates will be increased as we promised during the General Election campaign. The new rates will be £4.88 for 3- and 4-year-olds and £5.39 for 2-year-olds. The Childcare Review has provided strong evidence that provider costs vary substantially across different parts of the country. There is therefore a strong rationale for varying funding rates between areas. We know however that there are historical inconsistencies and inefficiencies with the current funding system for 3- and 4-year-olds. We will introduce a national funding formula for early years so that funding is transparently and fairly matched to need and fairly distributed between different types of providers and different parts of the country.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will estimate the number of children in Solihull constituency that would be currently eligible for 30 hours free childcare.,"We will publish figures for individual local authorities in due course. We can confirm that the additional 15 hours will be available to families where both parents are working (or the sole parent is working in a lone parent family) with each parent earning a weekly minimum equivalent to 16 hours at national minimum wage or living wage. Working will include employed and self-employed parents. In general families where one parent does not work (or neither parent works) will not be eligible for these additional hours. However we intend to make provision so that parents in certain circumstances will be regarded as being in work. This includes in the case of couple families where one parent is in receipt of benefits relating to caring responsibilities or a disability and those on parental leave. More information is set out in the December 2015 Policy Statement which is available online at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childcare-bill-policy-statement\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childcare-bill-policy-statement</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate her Department has made of the proportion of (a) private (b) voluntary and (c) independent nurseries which will provide the additional 15 hours of childcare under the provisions of the Childcare Act 2016.,The Department for Education publishes data on the number of children benefitting from funded early education places by type of provider and local authority. The latest information can be found in the Statistical First Release <em>Provision for children under five years of age in England</em>: January 2015 (SFR20/2015). As part of our ongoing development of our 30 hours implementation plans we are consulting extensively with key stakeholders including representative organisations and other individual providers. The government will continue to support the growth and creation of new places to deliver the 30 hours funded entitlement through investing at least £50 million of capital investment to support the creation of additional early years places. This is in addition to our commitment to capital funding to create nursery provision as part of new Free Schools which we estimate will create at least 4000 places.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the average hourly cost per child is to the public purse of the additional 15 hours free childcare provided for under the Childcare Act 2016 in (a) the UK (b) the North West and (c) Rochdale.,Currently the national average hourly rate paid by the Department for Education to local authorities in England is £4.56. From April 2017 the national average funding rate paid by the Department will increase to £4.88 per hour for three- and four-year-olds. This includes the average spend on the early years pupil premium which at current rates is approximately 5p per child per hour. More government investment and support than ever before is going towards high-quality early education: funding for the early years entitlements will increase from £2.7 billion per year to £3.9 billion per year during the course of this Parliament and this includes an uplift of £300 million per year. We recognise that the current funding system for funded early education creates unfair and unjustifiable differences between areas and providers. That is why we have announced that we will introduce a national funding formula for early years. The Government will be consulting on detailed proposals later this year. These figures refer to England as the early years entitlements are a devolved matter.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate her Department has made of the (a) likely level of uptake for the extra 15 hour a week childcare provided for under the Childcare Act 2016 and (b) number of people eligible for that extra childcare under the provisions of that Act.,The Government estimates that around 390000 three- and four-year-olds will be eligible for the additional 15 hours of free childcare and we expect that the majority of parents with eligible children will want to take up this generous offer. During our 2015 consultation we conducted an online survey and of nearly 20000 respondents around 89% said they would take up the additional hours if they were available now.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many children in (a) Leeds North West constituency and (b) Leeds city region are eligible for 15 hours free childcare.,"All three- and four-year-olds are eligible for funded early education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to evaluate the pilot schemes on increasing free childcare entitlement to 30 hours per week.,We are currently commissioning the evaluation of early implementation of 30 hours free childcare. An invitation to tender was published in May 2016 with a view to awarding the contract to a successful bidder by the end of June 2016.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will review funding levels for the care of 2 year old children.,The Prime Minister has committed publicly to an uplift in funding rates for early learning places which includes an uplift in funding levels for two year olds who are eligible for 15 hours of free early learning each week. An announcement was made in the November 2015 Autumn Statement indicating that a generous uplift would be made in the funding that early years providers will receive from April 2017. As a result of this extra investment the new national average rates will increase from £4.56 to £4.88 for three and four year olds (including the Early Years Pupil Premium) and from £5.09 to £5.39 for two year olds. The new funding amounts to an additional £300 million per year from 2017-18.The government is committed to making funding for the early years fairer. Thats why the government conducted its <em>Review of childcare costs: call for evidence</em> consultation between 15 June 2015 and 10 August 2015 to determine a rate of funding that is sustainable for providers and delivers value for money to the taxpayer. The findings of this review provided the government with vital evidence which has helped to inform the proposed increase in funding rates from 2017/18. We will consult on the proposed new funding allocation system shortly.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many (a) nursery schools (b) day-care facilities and (c) children's centres have closed due to funding shortages in each of the last three years.,The department does not collect information on the reasons for the closure of nursery schools day-care facilities or childrens centres. Nursery schoolsThe number of closed nursery schools are given by year in the table below. <table><tbody>Calendar YearNumber of MNS Closures201332014420155</tbody></table> Local authorities have a duty to secure sufficient childcare in their local area. In consultation with their Schools Forum they are responsible for deciding how best to distribute early years funding across their locality. There is a presumption against the closure of any maintained nursery school. The local authority must consult on any proposed closures clearly demonstrating the rationale for so doing. Day-care facilitiesThe childcare market has steadily expanded. The latest figures from the Childcare Providers Survey (September 2014) shows that the: <ul>number of registered places in full day care settings rose by ten per cent between 2011 and 2013. long term increase in the number of full day care providers continued in 2013. In total there were 17900 full day care settings in 2013 (compared to 17600 in 2011).</ul> Children's centresLocal authorities have a duty under the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure sufficient childrens centres to meet the needs of local families. Local authorities must meet their statutory duties on childrens centres from funding that forms part of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) Business Rates Retention Scheme. In addition other government funding including that for public health adult skills training and troubled families may also be used locally to support services delivered wholly or in part through childrens centres. Local authorities must consult fully before any significant changes are made to childrens centre services. There is a strong network of childrens centres. At 31 December 2015 there were 2605 main childrens centres open and 731 additional sites offering access to early childhood services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to increase entrepreneurship and business education in schools.,Entrepreneurship and business education are important components of both high quality careers education and guidance as well as a broad education offer for pupils.The careers statutory guidance places a responsibility on schools in England to offer pupils the opportunity to develop entrepreneurial skills and have access to advice on options available post-16 including entrepreneurship. While it is for schools to decide how best to provide entrepreneurship education we know that contact with entrepreneurs themselves and businesses more widely is essential. That is why we are funding The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company to increase the number and quality of contacts between young people and businesses including entrepreneurs.We have revised the business GCSE so that from September 2017 there is greater depth and breadth and a clearer focus on the overall purpose features and workings of businesses and how to apply this knowledge in a business context.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to the report of Ofsted on its inspection of Audenshaw School Academy Trust which took place on 23 and 24 February 2016 if she will make an assessment of the effect on the students for whom pupil premium funding was intended of that funding being saved for a capital project.,The conditions of grant for the pupil premium make clear that its purpose is to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether additional funding will be provided to support further education students who have to travel further to access education as a result of colleges merging.,Future college mergers will tend to be decided through area reviews of post-16 education which are focused on meeting the needs of learners in each area. Area reviews because they are overseen by steering groups including Chairs and Principals of colleges as well as local authorities are well placed to ensure decisions are taken which are in the interests of local further education students taking into account travel to learn distances. The steering groups recommendations will always be based on the best available evidence including an analysis of local economic and educational needs and the mapping of current curriculum provision and travel to learn patterns.As well as being members of area review steering groups local authorities have statutory responsibility for transport to education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds. We expect local authorities to make reasonable decisions about the support they offer based on the needs of their young people local transport infrastructure and the resources they have available. Authorities will need to take account of the recommendations arising from each area review and the impact on transport for learners. Local authorities fund any support they provide for transport to post-16 education through the grants they receive from national government and through generated income such as council tax.Most 16- to 19-year olds have access to a discount or concession on local travel from their local transport provider their local authority or from their education or training provider. The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is also available to support young people with the costs associated with attending education or training and transport is the biggest single area of expenditure for which this fund is used.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many funding agreements have been terminated by each regional schools commissioner.,A funding agreement is contract between the Secretary of State and an academy trust. The model funding agreement states that the agreement can be terminated under the following grounds: termination by either party; by warning notice; by the Secretary of State after inspection; by the Secretary of State; and a change of control.The Regional Schools Commissioners (RSCs) are civil servants and as such carry out their duties in the name of the Secretary of State. The RSCs have powers to make a decision on behalf of the Secretary of State to replace a sponsor or trust where they have not been able to secure necessary improvements. In some circumstances the funding agreement may be terminated as part of the process.As with other areas of their responsibility RSCs escalate decisions to the National Schools Commissioner or the relevant minister where they are sensitive raise issues of interpretation of government policy or relate to urgent safeguarding or extremism concerns.The decision to terminate a funding agreement that results in the closure of an academy is made by the Secretary of State.Listed below are the numbers of academy closures and re-brokerages by region since the RSCs appointment in September 2014:<table><tbody>RSCRe-brokeredClosedTotalEast Midlands &amp; Humber28735Lancashire &amp; West Yorkshire15318North639North East London &amp; East15217North West London &amp; South Central10212South London &amp; South East9413South West28129West Midlands11314Total12225147</tbody></table>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what measures she plans to take to support further education students with additional travel costs arising from mergers of institutions as a result of area reviews of post-16 education.,Area reviews of post-16 education are focused on meeting the needs of learners in each area and because they are overseen by steering groups including Chairs and Principals of colleges as well as local authorities they are well placed to do this. The steering groups discussions and recommendations are based on the best available evidence including an analysis of local economic and educational needs and the mapping of current curriculum provision and travel to learn patterns. Recommendations made by the steering group including mergers should improve access to better quality teaching delivered by sustainable institutions focused on meeting learner need.Local authorities are members of area review steering groups and have statutory responsibility for transport to education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much funding was allocated to schools for supporting children with learning difficulties in (a) Manchester Withington constituency and (b) Greater Manchester in each of the last three years.,Funding for children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) is allocated to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant which includes both funding to be delegated to mainstream schools and funding for the additional costs associated with educating children and young people with high needs.Schools are funded through a formula set by their local authority and local authorities are required to delegate funds to a level that enables schools to meet the additional cost of pupils with SEN up to £6000 per annum. It is for individual schools to decide how they allocate their overall budget to ensure they meet the specific needs of children with learning difficulties.For those pupils whose additional support costs more than £6000 the local authority pays top-up funding to the schools from their high needs budget. Top-up funding rates are for local authorities to agree with their schools.The high needs allocation within the dedicated schools grant for the Greater Manchester local authorities in each of the last three years were as set out below:<table><tbody> 2013-14 (£million)2014-15 (£million)2015-16 (£million)Bolton25.8327.1527.55Bury22.5024.0824.17Manchester59.8363.3464.07Oldham23.5424.9025.58Salford22.1022.7522.82Stockport27.6229.0429.44Tameside25.8227.1428.23Trafford13.8114.7914.73Wigan22.8823.3424.08</tbody></table>We do not hold information on the total funding for supporting children with learning difficulties allocated to schools in the Manchester Withington constituency or in the Greater Manchester area.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to improve transparency and accountability in spending by schools.,Appropriate arrangements are currently in place to ensure that school spending is transparent. Details of income and expenditure in all maintained schools and academies are published annually by the department in Statistical First Releases available on GOV.UK. The Permanent Secretarys Accountability System Statement sets out in detail the accountability system for education including maintained schools and academies and for childrens services.While we are always interested in improving transparency and accountability in spending by schools we have no current plans for changes.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education for what reason the school specific factors and historic grant factors elements of the payment by the Education Funding Authority to the King David School Manchester were reduced by over £1 million in 2013-14.,In 2012-13 King David School received £1.1 million in School Specific factors and Historic Grant funding. For 2013-14 local funding formulae were simplified and the number of allowable formula factors was reduced. This meant that any funding previously allocated through other factors such as Historic Grants had to be moved into one of the allowable factors. Manchester LA chose to distribute this funding at pupil level in 2013-14 using the Age Weighted Pupil Unit (AWPU) factor the sum of money allocated to the school for each pupil according to age. As such King David School received an increase of £630000 in AWPU for 2013-14. Schools were also protected against losses from the introduction of the new formula using a minimum funding guarantee (MFG). In 2013-14 King David School received an increase of £430000 under the MFG. Overall pre-16 School Budget share funding (including MFG) for the school was £3239833 for 596 pupils in 2012-13 and £3236489 for 586 pupils in 2013-14.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much funding was allocated to schools for supporting children with learning difficulties in (a) Mid Sussex constituency and (b) West Sussex in each of the last three years.,Funding for children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) is allocated to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant which includes both funding to be delegated to mainstream schools and funding for the additional costs associated with educating children and young people with high needs.Schools are funded through a formula set by their local authority and local authorities are required to delegate funds to a level that enables schools to meet the additional cost of pupils with SEN up to £6000 per annum. It is for individual schools to decide how they allocate their overall budget to ensure they meet the specific needs of children with learning difficulties.For those pupils whose additional support costs more than £6000 the local authority pays top-up funding to the schools from their high needs budget. Top-up funding rates are for local authorities to agree with their schools.West Sussex County Councils high needs allocation within the dedicated schools grant in each of the last three years was as follows:<ul>2013-14 Ò £67.69m2014-15 Ò £70.53m2015-16 Ò £71.64m</ul>We do not hold information on the total funding allocated by West Sussex County Council for supporting children with learning difficulties to schools in the Mid Sussex constituency or in the West Sussex county area.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the total amount paid in pupil premium funding to schools in Coventry in each year since the beginning of such funding; and if she will make a statement.,Total pupil premium allocations for schools in Coventry local authority for each year are:<table><tbody>Pupil Premium Allocations (£millions)2011-20122012-20132013-20142014-20152015-2016Coventry local authority (including academies)5.1579.29914.38318.85818.634</tbody></table>     
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the number of schools that may be in deficit by 2020 as a result of changes to the schools funding formula.,It is important that school funding is allocated fairly and transparently according to need. The proposed national funding formula will put an end to the unfair arrangements whereby pupils who live in one local area attract more funding than pupils with the same characteristics who live in another area. In the first stage of the consultation we set out the principles behind the formula and the factors we propose to include. We will set out further details in the second stage of the consultation which will launch later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether it is her Department's policy to provide additional funding to Local Education Authorities for secondary schools if (a) free schools and (b) other new schools open in that area during a financial year.,"The department does not provide any additional funding to local authorities in the financial year that a new secondary school is established. We do provide funding to academy trusts to cover essential expenditure to establish a new school before it opens. New schools receive funding for a limited number of years after the school opens to cover the start-up costs associated with running a new school which cannot be met from core funding. Details of these grants can be found at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487778/Free_Schools_application_process_-_background_information_and_glossary.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487778/Free_Schools_application_process_-_background_information_and_glossary.pdf</a> Where a local authority opens a new school (to meet basic need in that area) the local authority is responsible for providing the site for the new school and meeting associated capital and start-up costs which it is expected to do from its Dedicated Schools Grant allocation and its basic need capital allocation."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the cost is to the public purse of school expenditure on supporting pupils who do not have English as their first language.,Under current funding arrangements local authorities devise funding formulae through which to distribute funding to schools in their localities. One of the factors local authorities can include is an English as an additional language (EAL) factor. EAL funding is determined on the basis of census data which records whether or not a pupils first language is English. In 2015-16 a total of £267 million was allocated through this factor to school budgets. This figure does not represent the cost of supporting pupils with EAL; instead it forms part of the schools core budget. It is then for school leaders to determine how best to use their whole budget so that all pupils can reach their full potential. We will introduce a national funding formula from 2017-18 so that funding is fair and matched to need. Our first consultation which closed on 17 April proposed that the formula should include an EAL factor. We are reviewing all the responses and will set out the precise detail of the formula in our second consultation to be published later this year. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential effect of the Government's plan to make every school an academy on nursery school education.,The government has confirmed that the expectation that all schools will become academies by 2020 does not include the early years. We know that close working between primary schools Ò whether they are academies or maintained schools - and nursery schools is essential to improving pupils transition to Reception. We would expect those excellent local relationships that already exist to continue regardless of whether the school is an academy or not.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many and what proportion of schools have a mental health specialist as a permanent member of staff.,Schools have the autonomy to decide on the provision of mental health support. We have recently commissioned an extensive survey which will provide nationally representative estimates of what provision schools and colleges offer for mental health and character education. The fieldwork will begin in the summer term.We have also contributed to a £3m joint pilot with NHS England for training single points of contact in schools and specialist mental health services to ensure that children and young people have timely access to specialist support where needed.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 24 March 2015 to Question 31427 whether her Department plans to provide additional funding to enable 25 per cent of secondary schools to extend their school day in the event that less than £285 million is available from the soft drinks industry levy.,The Chancellor announced in his Budget statement that up to £285 million a year would be made available to give 25% of secondary schools increased opportunity to extend their school day to offer a wider range of activities for pupils. The soft drinks industry levy is expected to raise £520 million in the first year and the revenue will contribute to this funding.It is also confirmed that the Barnett formula will be applied to spending on this initiative in the normal way.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the number of new nursery staff in (a) Burnley and (b) Lancashire who will be affected by the new requirements for staff taking a Level 3 in childcare.,The requirements have been in effect since 2014 for individuals taking the level 3 Early Years Educator qualifications. The requirement for level 3 Early Years Educator staff to hold a GCSE Maths and English at grade C or above was introduced to make sure that new entrants to the workforce have the numeracy and literacy skills they need to operate in a level 3 role. Staff working in level 3 roles can have a range of responsibilities all of which require them to be highly skilled and well-qualified. Level 3 staff are likely to work directly with children and many will have additional responsibility as room leaders and some will lead and manage an entire childcare setting. The department holds national data on level 3 staff in the early years sector. We know excellent progress has been made over the past few years in which qualification levels have continued to rise. Between 2008 and 2013 the proportion of the 233200 full day care staff with at least a level 3 qualification grew from 75% to 87%[1]. We are continuing to collect data on level 3 staff through the Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey this year and will collect data from 2016 in the Early Years Census. We have been talking to childcare employers and training organisations about early years qualifications. We want to continue to work with the sector to understand the challenges faced and find ways to tackle these whilst ensuring a quality workforce remains.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what weighting her Department gives to deprivation as a factor affecting educational outcomes.,The department recognises that deprivation is a strong predictor of pupils future attainment and acts as a proxy for a range of barriers to educational success including low aspiration for the future low levels of parental education and special educational needs. Overcoming these barriers can create additional costs for schools as they seek to provide additional support. This is why we have committed to continuing the pupil premium at current rates for the duration of this Parliament. Worth £2.5bn this year the pupil premium provides schools with significant extra funding to help disadvantaged pupils achieve their full potential. Since its introduction in 2011 the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed at age 11 and age 16 offering disadvantaged pupils a more prosperous future as adults. We are committed to introducing a national funding formula so that schools funding is matched fairly and consistently to need. In our recent consultation on the principles and building blocks of a national funding formula we proposed to include a deprivation factor. We will set out the detail of the formula in a second consultation to be published later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to support young people with their mental health needs in the Stockport local authority area.,"Good mental health and wellbeing is a key priority for the Department. We have high aspirations for all children and want them to be able to fulfil their potential both academically and in terms of their mental wellbeing. Schools can play an important role in supporting pupils with mental health issues. We want them to decide how best to meet the needs of their pupils. We have taken a range of actions to help them build a whole-school approach to good mental wellbeing. We funded guidance and age-appropriate lesson plans on teaching mental health in PSHE and have supported the development of MindEd a free online portal which enables all adults working with children and young people learn more about specific mental health problems and how to support them. We have recently revised and updated our blueprint for effective school-based counselling and published guidance on mental health and behaviour.<a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a> We know that schools are sharing practice in Stockport. For instance the Pendlebury Centre has developed training programmes and measuring tools which it is sharing as part of its role as a teaching school. More widely the government is making £1.4bn available over the course of this Parliament to transform local children and young peoples mental health services to deliver more integrated and accessible services. Clinical Commissioning Groups have been required to produce plans that set out how they will transform children and young peoples mental health services locally to make them more accessible and increase the focus on prevention. Stockport Clinical Commissioning Group has led a multi-agency partnership in collaboration with Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council to develop a 5-year-plan to improve the availability appropriateness and effectiveness of mental health services for children and young people in Stockport.<a href=\""http://stockportccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Local-Transformation-Plan-2015-16-Summary-Document.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://stockportccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Local-Transformation-Plan-2015-16-Summary-Document.pdf</a>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment she has made of the operation of the fair funding formula for schools; and when she expects the latest revision to that formula to be implemented.,The first stage of a two-part consultation for national funding formulae for schools and high needs closed on 17 April. We are currently considering the responses. We will publish the second stage of the consultation later this year alongside the governments response to the first stage of the consultation. This second stage will set out the detailed design of the formulas and will provide illustrative allocations for all schools and areas. We have proposed to introduce the new national funding formulae from 2017-18.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much funding was allocated to schools for supporting children with learning difficulties in (a) Corby constituency and (b) East Northamptonshire in each of the last three years.,Funding for children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) is allocated to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant which includes both funding to be delegated to mainstream schools and funding for the additional costs associated with educating children and young people with high needs.Schools are funded through a formula set by their local authority and local authorities are required to delegate funds to a level that enables schools to meet the additional cost of pupils with SEN up to £6000 per annum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how deprivation factors are taken into account in school funding formulae.,"In current funding arrangements each local authority devises a local funding formula through which they distribute funding to schools in their locality. The formula must include a deprivation factor and local authorities have the flexibility to use a pupil-based measure (eligibility for free school meals (FSM)) an area-based measure (the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index which is known as IDACI) or both in order to identify pupils eligible for this funding.We are committed to introducing a national funding formula so that schools funding is matched fairly and consistently to need. In our recent consultation on the principles and building blocks of a national funding formula which closed on 17 April we proposed to include a deprivation factor which uses a combination of the FSM and IDACI measures to identify eligible pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services on the health wellbeing and performance of young people in schools and colleges.,We want children to do well academically. Attainment is supported if students have good health and mental wellbeing and when they have access to specialist mental health services where they need it.The Government is investing an additional £1.4bn in childrens mental health this Parliament. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across the country have worked with partners including schools and colleges to produce local transformation plans for children and young peoples mental health services. These should set out what will be done locally to make the best use of the resources available Ò changing how child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are delivered in response to the challenges set out in the Future in Mind report and increasing the focus on preventative activity. NHS England has put the plans through an assurance process before releasing funds and is carrying out an analysis of plans to identify practice that can be shared to inform future planning.In addition we have contributed to a £3m joint pilot with NHS England which is testing how single points of contact in CAMHS and schools can secure effective mental health support to pupils. The pilots are involving over 250 schools in 27 CCG areas through joint training which supports schools and CAMHS leads to identify specific activity to improve support in their area.The Department of Health has commissioned a new survey into the prevalence of mental health conditions in children and young people in England the first since 2004.

We want to understand what improvements can be made to help more staff reach their potential and forge a successful career in the early years.We began discussions with a range of stakeholders in the sector earlier this year on the elements of a workforce strategy and we are continuing to speak to stakeholders as we develop the strategy further. We plan to communicate an update to the sector on the workforce strategy in the coming months.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans her Department has to meet demand for school places in Somerton and Frome constituency.,Supporting local authorities to ensure sufficient school places continues to be one of the Governments top priorities. That is why we have committed to spending £7 billion on school places up to 2021 which along with our investment in the free schools programme we expect to deliver 600000 new places. Somerset received £14.6 million of basic need funding between 2011 and 2015 which helped to create almost 3000 new places between 2010 and 2015. It has also been allocated a further £24.5 million to create the places needed by 2019.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what progress her Department is making on ensuring that funding is distributed fairly across schools.,The fair distribution of funding is a priority for this Government. A National Funding Formula will ensure that every school is allocated funding fairly and transparently according to need.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that people leaving sixth form are fully aware of all further education options open to them.,We are taking a number of steps to ensure that the full range of education and training options are widely understood by young people. Schools are legally required to secure independent careers guidance for pupils up to the age of 18. This must include information on the full range of education and training options including apprenticeships.Destination measures are a key tool to assess how well schools and colleges prepare their students to make a successful transition into the next stage of education or training or employment. The key stage 5 measure looks at activity in the year after the young person took A level or other level 3 qualifications. Destination measures will be one of the headline performance measures in the 2016 performance tables if the data are robust enough. They are taken into account by Ofsted during school inspections.However the range of information that young people receive remains too narrow and we want to ensure that young people hear much more consistently about the merits of alternatives to academic routes and are aware of all the routes to higher skills and into the workplace. The government intends to bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity that will require schools to allow other education and training providers the opportunity to talk to students about their offer on school premises.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the implications for her policies of the conclusion in the report from Sense entitled Making the case for play published in February 2016 that a misguided interpretation and approach to health and safety is creating a barrier to accessing play settings and activities for children with multiple needs.,"I refer the Honourable Member to the answer given on 11 April to PQ 32244 which I have also set out below:The government recognises that play is essential for childrens development and this is covered in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework. Play has an important role in supporting all young children to develop and prepare for later learning and the EYFS is clear that Ïpractitioners must consider the individual needs interests and stage of development of each child in their care_ to plan a challenging and enjoyable experience for each child in all of the areas of learning and development. Health and safety should not create a barrier to accessing play activities for children with multiple needs.The staff working in early years settings as Early Years Educators (level 3) and Early Years Teachers (graduates) are required to have an understanding of different pedagogical approaches including the role of play in supporting early learning and development. The criteria for the Early Years Educator and standards for Early Years Teacher Status qualifications are set by the department. However it is the responsibility of early years settings to provide play opportunities for their children and pupils including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).Ofsted conducts a regular cycle of inspection to ensure that provision meets the required quality and safety standards and assesses the extent to which the learning and care provided by the setting meets the needs of the range of children who attend including the needs of any children who have SEND.As you may be aware the Childcare Act 2016 expands the free childcare entitlement from 15 to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds of working parents. As part of the Early Implementer Package announced on Tuesday 2 February local authorities involved will be using the opportunity to test and showcase how childcare can be delivered in a way that improves access for children with SEND. The department also launched a consultation on 3 April seeking views on key elements of the operation and delivery of the 30 hours and we specifically welcome views on provision for children with SEND. The consultation is available at: <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/30-hour-free-childcare-entitlement\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/consultations/30-hour-free-childcare-entitlement</a>."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education when her Department last reviewed its statutory guidance on post-16 transport to education and training.,The statutory guidance for local authorities on post-16 transport was updated in February 2014 following the implementation of Raising the Participation Age (RPA). It was last reviewed in February 2016 and was found to be still up-to-date; there are no immediate changes planned to the guidance.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department is taking steps to introduce independent and impartial advice from qualified professionals into careers advice and guidance.,All maintained schools have a legal duty to secure access to independent careers guidance for year 8-13 pupils. Guidance secured under the duty must be delivered in an impartial manner.The duty gives schools the flexibility to commission a broad range of support for pupils Ò from careers advisers but also from employers mentors and coaches who can give young people real-life insight into the world of work. This allows schools to identify their own priorities and configure their careers education and guidance offer to meet the needs of their pupils. The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company is taking a lead role in transforming the provision of careers enterprise and employer engagement experiences for young people to inspire them and prepare them for the world of work.Careers professionals can play an important role in supporting pupils as one element of a varied careers programme. The careers statutory guidance is clear that schools should include consideration of the role that careers professionals can play in supporting pupils. The statutory guidance provides information about the register of careers professionals developed by the Career Development Institute which schools can use to search for a career development professional who can deliver a particular service or activity.Ofsted has given higher priority to careers guidance in school inspections - and destination measures help schools and colleges to be held to account locally and inform choices by parents and students.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many school-aged pupils there are with at least one parent who is a national in another EEA member state in households with a total income within the threshold for pupil premium eligibility.,Pupil premium eligibility in 2015/16 is based on whether pupils are known to have been looked after by the local authority; have left care through adoption a special guardianship child arrangements or residence order; or if a pupil has been registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the last 6 years. It is not determined through a household income threshold. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 15 March 2016 to the hon. Member for St Albans to Question 30490 on pupil premium if she will estimate the number of children eligible to receive pupil premium funding with at least one non-UK EEA national parent in each year since 2011-12.,The Department does not collect data on the identity or characteristics of individual pupils parents (including details of parental nationality) so cannot offer a meaningful estimate of the number of pupil premium pupils with at least one parent who is a non-UK EEA national.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the number of places available in local authority maintained nurseries in (a) Dartford and (b) Kent.,"Local authorities are required to report annually to elected council members on how they are meeting their duty to secure sufficient childcare and early education places and make this report available and accessible to parents. The Department does not hold borough-level estimates centrally of the number of places in local authority maintained nursery schools. However the number of pupils attending local authority maintained nurseries can be found in the statistical first release and underlying data published at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2015\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2015</a>The Local authority and regional tables: SFR16/2015 (Table 7b)[1] indicates that 90 pupils were registered as attending local authority maintained nursery schools in Kent in 2015.[1] <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445755/SFR16_2015_LA_tables.xlsx\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445755/SFR16_2015_LA_tables.xlsx</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if the Government will make it its policy to allocate revenue raised from the soft drinks industry levy to maintain the grant for summer schools.,The Government has no plans to use the soft drink levy to maintain the grant for pupil premium summer schools. The 2016 budget statement identified that the soft drinks industry levy would be used to double the amount of funding to £320m per annum that we dedicate to sport in every primary school and to make it easier for up to a quarter of secondary schools to extend their school day to include a wider range of activities including extra sport.The Government has protected the pupil premium at current per pupil rates for the rest of the Parliament providing schools with around £2.5 billion per year of additional funding to support their disadvantaged pupils. Schools have the choice to continue running summer schools and can use their pupil premium allocation to fund places for their disadvantaged pupils.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to paragraph 1.89 of the Budget 2016 when she expects Sir Nick Weller's report into transforming education across the Northern Powerhouse to be published.,The allocation of this funding will depend on the identified need and will be reassessed each year based on the evidence. We intend to build on the Departments strategy for Achieving Excellence Areas as identified in our recent White Paper. Decisions on allocation of funding for the 16-17 financial year will be made by the autumn of this year and will be informed by the emerging findings of the review by Sir Nick Weller. We will be publishing the terms of reference for Sir Nick Wellers report in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to paragraph 1.89 of Budget 2016 how much of the £20 million a year of new funding for a Northern Powerhouse school strategy she expects will be directly received by schools in Lancashire.,The allocation of this funding will depend on the identified need and will be reassessed each year based on the evidence. We intend to build on the Departments strategy for Achieving Excellence Areas as identified in our recent White Paper. Decisions on allocation of funding for the 16-17 financial year will be made by the autumn of this year and will be informed by the emerging findings of the review by Sir Nick Weller. We will be publishing the terms of reference for Sir Nick Wellers report in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many local authority schools have been found not to have kept records of eligibility for free school meals in each of the last three years.,It is a statutory requirement for all schools to return free school meals eligibility data via the school census and the Department has a process for checking that returns are accurate.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many academy schools have been found to have failed to keep records of eligibility for free school meals in each of the last three years.,The Education Funding Agency (EFA) undertakes academy trust funding audit visits as part of its assurance regime which includes free school meals. It has found the following instances where full records have not been kept:<table><tbody>Assurance plan yearTotal trusts where instances of pupil ineligibility were identified1 July 2015 Ò present<em>Currently underway therefore no information</em>1 July 2014 Ò 30 June 201501 July 2013 Ò 30 June 20149</tbody></table>In addition we have received one instance where we have confirmed ineligibility of funding and are taking swift action to resolve issues.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to paragraph 1.89 of Budget 2016 how much of the £500 million of additional core funding for schools will be allocated to schools in Lancashire.,"The funding announced at the Budget has been provided to support the Departments school reform agenda. This will allow us to spend around £500 million over the Spending Review period in addition to the per pupil protection of the core school budget announced at the spending review to speed up the introduction of a fair national funding formula. Our current consultation on a National Funding Formula for schools outlines the principles of the funding system and the funding factors that we believe should define the national funding formula for schools. This consultation closes on 17 April and having considered the responses to this consultation later this year we will launch a second consultation. This second stage consultation will detail our proposals for weighting each factor the transitional arrangements and illustrate the distribution of funding for schools and local authorities that that implies including the allocation of this funding. Until then I am unable to comment on how additional funding will be allocated to schools in Lancashire.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if the free childcare pilot scheme budget will be ring-fenced from September 2016.,As you may be aware the Government has allocated £13m to DfE for early implementation allowing some families to access the additional 15 hour places from September 2016. The Department plans to ring-fence this funding available for early implementers.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy to ring-fence special educational needs funding as part of her Department's new national funding formula.,We are currently consulting on arrangements for new national formulae for schools and high needs funding (funding for pupils with high cost Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND)). Both funding streams along with early years funding make up the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which is ring-fenced so that local authorities can only spend it on specified elements of education. The DSG will continue to be ring-fenced when the national funding formulae are in place. We have also protected the high needs budget in this Parliament and the previous one. We recently added £92.5 million to the 2016-17 allocations. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether it is her policy that all children in households in receipt of Universal Credit will be entitled to free school meals.,We will continue to ensure that all children from the poorest families benefit from a free school meal. The introduction of Universal Credit and simplification of the benefits system mean that the eligibility criteria for free school meals will need to be updated. The Department for Education is continuing to work closely with the Department for Work and Pensions on this. In the meantime while this work is on-going any child whose parent or guardian is receiving Universal Credit will continue to be entitled to free school meals.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that (a) female and (b) other students are encouraged to take modules in entrepreneurship and business mentoring.,The government is committed to improving the extent and quality of the careers guidance and inspiration that all young people receive. This should begin with activities to enable children in primary school to explore the world of work. Primary Futures is an example of an initiative that helps primary age children to see a clear link and purpose between their learning and their futures.The Department for Education has funded The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company to take a lead role in transforming the provision of careers enterprise and employer engagement experiences for young people aged 12 to 18 in England. This work includes ensuring that all students have access to high quality careers and enterprise provision including interactions with employers. The Company helps employers schools and colleges and other organisations to navigate their way through the existing landscape and find appropriate careers and enterprise organisations to partner with. An example of a successful initiative is the three-year industry-led Your Life campaign which was launched by the Government in 2014. This aims to inspire young people particularly girls to study A level maths and physics as a gateway to an exciting and wide-ranging career.Entrepreneurship education is an important component of high quality careers provision. The careers statutory guidance requires schools in England to offer pupils the opportunity to develop entrepreneurial skills and have access to advice on options available post-16 including entrepreneurship.We are giving more young people access to a mentor to help raise aspirations improve focus and attainment and help prepare them for the next stage in their lives. The Prime Minister announced on 14 March 2016 that the government will commit £12 million over this parliament for an investment fund to build capacity in the system to recruit and train a new generation of high-quality mentors focussing on teenagers most at risk of under-achieving or dropping out of education. This will be supported by a national advertising campaign.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to encourage nurseries to teach early language skills.,"The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework sets the standards for the provision of learning development and care for children from birth to five year olds that all registered early years providers such as maintained nurseries must follow. Within the EYFS there are several areas of learning and development that shape the educational programme in the early years settings one of which is communication and language.The EYFS makes clear that children should be given opportunities to experience a rich language environment to help them develop the confidence and skills they need to express themselves and to speak and listen in a range of situations. The EYFS requires practitioners to ensure all children have the opportunities to learn and develop a good standard of English language to ensure they are ready to benefit from the opportunities available to them when they begin primary school.We have also worked closely with 4Children to develop the <em>What to Expect When?</em> guide which illustrates to parents and early years providers the tools they can use to help their childrens language development from birth to five years old and can be found at: <a href=\http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/2015/03/what-to-expect-when-a-parents-guide/\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/2015/03/what-to-expect-when-a-parents-guide/</a>The Department for Education has also awarded £5.3 million to voluntary and community sector organisations of which a number are supporting staff to develop strong pedagogical approaches to language development and early literacy."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 11 March 2016 to Question 29817 whether her Department holds information on the number of children who have been further assessed after the strength and difficulties questionnaire score suggested that there may be a problem with that child's mental health.,The Department does not hold information on the number of children who have undergone further assessment following the completion of a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).The Government has made available £1.4 billion over five years to implement the blueprint set out in <em>Future in mind</em> to transform childrens mental health services including for those looked after and other vulnerable groups. Together with the Department of Health and working with NHS England and others we are establishing an expert group to develop care pathways that will support an integrated approach to meeting the mental health needs of looked-after children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the effect of pupil premium on ensuring children who are classed as behind reach their expected grades at Key Stages 1 to 4.,"The Government is determined to deliver educational excellence everywhere so that every child regardless of background reaches their full potential.Information on the proportion of low achieving disadvantaged pupils reaching the expected standard at key stage 4 is available from the KS2-4 transition matrices for disadvantaged pupils[1] on RAISEonline. These show progression from sub-levels at key stage 2 to grades at key stage 4 for a range of subjects for both disadvantaged and other pupils. Similar information is not published regularly for progression between other key stages.In 2015 the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee reviewed the pupil premium and concluded that while it is too early to assess the full impact of the funding there is evidence that the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has started to narrow.The Department for Education's gap index provides a more accurate measure over time in light of changes to assessments. It shows that attainment has risen and the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has narrowed - by 7.1 per cent at key stage 2 and 6.6 per cent at key stage 4 since 2011 the year the pupil premium was introduced.This means better prospects and a more prosperous life as an adult for this group of pupils. But we refuse to accept second best for any young person which is why we are continuing the pupil premium at current rates for the duration of this parliament providing funding to support schools to continue improving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.[1] <a href=\https://www.raiseonline.org/OpenDocument.aspx?document=381%20\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.raiseonline.org/OpenDocument.aspx?document=381%20</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the effectiveness of the year 7 catch-up premium in raising pupil attainment at GCSE level.,Since 2012 we have provided £500 per pupil funding to secondary schools for year 7 pupils who did not meet the expected standard in reading or mathematics at primary school. This funding enables schools to deliver additional support such as individual tuition or intensive support in small groups for those pupils that most need it.It is not possible to make an assessment of the effectiveness of the year 7 catch-up premium in raising pupil attainment at GCSE level as the first cohort of pupils to benefit from this funding in 2012 will now be in year 10 and have not yet entered GCSEs.We provide advice and guidance to schools on how they should use their funding and have published guidance on literacy and numeracy catch-up strategies which schools can consult when making decisions on how to spend their funding. Schools must publish details of how they spend their year 7 catch-up premium funding on the school website.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what criteria the Government plans to use to calculate each school's allocation of funds raised from the soft drinks industry levy for school sports.,Revenue from the soft drinks industry levy will be used to double the PE and sport premium for primary schools to £320m a year from September 2017 enabling them to improve the quality and breadth of PE and sport they offer. It will also provide up to £285m a year to enable up to a quarter of secondary schools to extend their school day to offer a wider range of activities including sports clubs. Further details will be announced in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education when she plans for the statutory guidance for local authorities entitled Post-16 transport to education and training next to be reviewed to take account of the raising of the education and training participation age to 18; and if she will make a statement.,The statutory guidance for local authorities on post-16 transport was updated in February 2014; it is reviewed annually and updated if necessary. The updated guidance includes information on the raising of the participation age along with a link to local authority guidance on participation.The statutory responsibility for transport to education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds rests with local authorities who we expect to make reasonable decisions about the support they offer based on the needs of their young people local transport infrastructure and the resources they have available.Most young people have access to some kind of discount or concession on bus or train travel either from their local authority local transport providers or from their school or college. The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is also available to support young people with the costs associated with attending education or training and transport is the biggest single area of expenditure for which this fund is used.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what her policy is on the maximum travelling time for a 16 to 18 year-old pupil to access sixth form education if it is not available in their local authority area; and if she will make a statement.,The statutory responsibility for transport to education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds rests with local authorities including those students who attend school or college in a neighbouring local authority area. Most students receive a discount or concession but it is for local authorities along with local transport providers and schools or colleges to decide whether to provide support and which students are eligible. These decisions are best made locally in light of local needs the resources available and other local circumstances. The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is also available to support young people with the costs associated with attending education or training and transport is the biggest single area of expenditure for which this fund is used. Schools and colleges are responsible for deciding how to distribute their bursary allocations to students and for establishing what criteria to use. Local authorities are encouraged to take travelling times into account when considering post-16 transport arrangements. There is an expectation of 75 minutes as a maximum travelling time each way to and from school or college but this is not a mandatory requirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answers of 14 March 2016 to Question 30445 and 21 March 2016 to Question 31491 what estimate she has made of the final number of enterprise co-ordinators.,The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company (CEC) has made excellent progress in its work to transform the provision of careers enterprise and employer engagement experiences for young people. The CEC is in the early stages of rolling out the Enterprise Adviser Network which involves Enterprise Co-ordinators overseeing employer volunteers (Enterprise Advisers) who work in schools and colleges to support their careers and enterprise provision. The CEC estimates that Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) will recruit 200 Enterprise Co-ordinators with an ambition to have an Enterprise Co-ordinator working with every secondary school. The Department for Education is in the process of agreeing the CECs targets for the forthcoming financial year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that schools take steps to promote the mental well-being of primary school students when they undertake Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 examinations.,Good mental health and wellbeing is a key priority for this Government. We have high aspirations for all children and want them to be able to fulfil their potential. Schools should consider how to provide appropriate support to their pupils based on their individual circumstances as part of a ÷whole-school approach. We have provided schools with a range of resources to support them in promoting mental wellbeing. We have funded guidance and age-appropriate lesson plans on teaching mental health in PSHE. At KS1 and 2 the lesson plans include teaching children how to describe emotions talk about anxiety and worries and develop coping strategies. Teachers and other staff can access MindEd a free online portal which provides information about specific mental health problems and how to support them.Other resources include guidance on mental health and behaviour and the provision of counselling in schools. However we recognise that teachers are not mental health professionals which is why we are contributing £1.5m to a joint pilot between schools and specialist mental health services to ensure pupils have timely access to appropriate specialist support where needed.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to her financial statement of 16 March 2016 Official Report column 963 how the £500 million funding will be used to speed up the introduction of a fair national school funding formula.,"The Chancellor announced at the Budget that £540 million would be provided to the Department for Education to support the school reform agenda. This will supplement the departments Spending Review settlement. We will spend around £500 million over the Spending Review period over and above the per pupil protection of the core school budget to accelerate the introduction of a fair national funding formula. All of this funding will be provided to support childrens education. The funding means that the government will be able to accelerate gains for schools that are due to see funding increases under the formula while continuing to offer a minimum funding guarantee for all schools. We are currently consulting on the principles and funding factors that should define the national funding formula for schools. A second consultation later this year will address the weighting attached to those factors and transitional arrangements including the use of this funding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much funding her Department received from the European Social Fund (a) between 2007 and 2014 and (b) from 2014 to the last month for which data is available.,The Department for Education was not directly in receipt of programme funding from the European Social Fund. The European Social Fund programme for England that operated from 2007 to 2013 (extended to 2015) did however include monies for young people aged 14-19 who were not in education employment or training or who were at risk of being so. This funding was administered initially by the Learning and Skills Council. From 2010 to July 2015 the funds have been administered by the Skills Funding Agency on behalf of the Young Peoples Learning Agency and then on behalf of the Education Funding Agency. Given the nature of this European Social Fund programme operated by arms length bodies across a number of departments without in depth analysis it is not possible to attribute funding for the period requested to particular departments. Such information will however be available in the Skills Funding Agencys evaluation of the programme which will be published later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to paragraph 1.89 of the Budget 2016 whether nursery schools are included in the plans to convert all schools to academies; how she expects the changes announced in the Budget 2016 to affect nursery schools; and if she will make a statement.,The expectation that all schools should become academies by 2020 set out in the 2016 Budget did not include the early years. The government has already announced an ambitious plan to transform early years provision so that working families can receive 30 hours free childcare. The consultation on the National Funding Formula for schools sets out the governments plans for replacing the arbitrary and unfair system for allocating primary and secondary school funding with a fairer system. Later this year we will consult on proposals for a fairer funding system for all of the early years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the contribution of nurseries to improving literacy rates.,The early years are a critical stage for a childs development. Nurseries have an important role in helping to ensure that all children start school with the knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress through school and life.All three- and four-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours a week of quality early education free of charge to prepare them for school and improve their life chances. This is extremely successful with 94% of three-year-olds and 99% of four-year-olds taking up the current free entitlement. From September 2017 we are introducing 15 hours of free childcare a week for the working parents of three- and four-year olds on top of the existing early education entitlement.The latest Early Years Foundation Stage Profile data reveal that an increasing proportion of children are achieving a good level of development at age five: 66% in 2015 compared to 52% in 2013.In the specific area of literacy 76% of children achieved at least the expected level in reading and 71% did so in writing in the academic year 2014/15.Parents also have an essential role to play in their childs development. In September 2015 we re-launched our popular guide for parents '<em>What to expect when?'</em> to include a strengthened focus on language communication and literacy.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make an assessment of the implications for her policy on extending 30 hour free childcare to three and four year olds of the findings of the Family and Childcare Trust 2016 childcare survey on the ability of nurseries to provide places for the current offer of 15 hours.,"The childcare sector is healthy vibrant and growing. More parents than ever are accessing high-quality free childcare and thanks to our plan to double the offer for working parents. We expect that trend to continue. Government statistics released in June 2015 show that the current take up rate for the 15 hours free early education entitlement is 99% for 4-year-olds and 94% for 3-year-olds. These latest figures also show 7000 more providers are offering the universal 15 hours offer with 1.3 million children the vast majority taking it up. The statistics are available on GOV.UK at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provision-for-children-under-5-years-of-age-january-2015\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provision-for-children-under-5-years-of-age-january-2015</a>. We will be investing over £1 billion more a year by 2019-20 on free childcare places for 2- 3- and 4-year-olds. This includes at least £50 million of capital funding to create additional early years places and over £300 million a year to increase the average hourly rate paid to childcare providers. This is in addition to our commitment to capital funding to create nursery provision as part of new Free Schools which we estimate will create up to 4000 places."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy to make the entitlement to an early education place a legal requirement.,English local authorities have a statutory duty under section 7 of the Childcare Act 2006 to secure a free early education place of 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year for all three- and four-year-olds and two-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria. The early education entitlement is not a legal requirement for parents and we know that the current model is extremely successful with 99% of four-year-olds and 94% of three-year-olds taking up a place. And Based on survey data collected from local authorities in the autumn of 2015 it is estimated that 182000 two-year-olds - around 72% of eligible children - have taken up a place on the two-year-old programme.The Secretary of State has a statutory duty under the Childcare Act 2016 to secure an additional 15 hours a week of free childcare for 38 weeks of the year for working parents of three- and four-year-olds.The Secretary of State will discharge the duty in clause 2 of the Childcare Act the duty to secure 30 hours of free childcare for working parents through all local authorities in England. Local authorities will therefore be required to secure childcare provision free of charge to qualifying children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to encourage schools to provide (a) support (b) guidance and (c) information for pupils with anorexia nervosa.,"Schools should consider how to provide appropriate support to all students based on their individual circumstances. One of the best ways is as part of a ÷whole-school approach in which pastoral and behavioural support systems recognise the role that all staff have a part to play in supporting and maintaining the positive emotional wellbeing for all pupils. This can include effective teaching about mental health through the Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) curriculum and involvement of specialists in schools who can provide more specific support where needed. We have funded guidance and age-appropriate lesson plans on teaching mental health in PSHE. This includes information on eating disorders. We have funded MindEd a free online portal which has been developed to enable all adults working with children and young people including teachers to learn more about specific mental health problems and how to support them. MindEd includes specific modules on eating disorders. MindEd is available at: <a href=\https://www.minded.org.uk/\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.minded.org.uk/</a>. We also have recently revised and updated our counselling guidance which provides practical evidence-based advice on how to ensure school based counselling services achieve the best outcomes for all students.

To increase this specialist support the Government is providing £150m to improve specialist treatment for children and young people diagnosed with eating disorders as part of its wider investment of an additional £1.4bn in children and young peoples mental health this Parliament. This funding is accompanied by a new standard specifically for young people with eating disorders aiming by 2020 to get 95% seen within four weeks or one week for urgent cases."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education for how many pupils the pupil premium has been paid in each year since its introduction; and how many pupils from which countries are eligible for the pupil premium.,"Since 2011-12 schools in England have received the Pupil Premium which targets funding at pupils from the most deprived backgrounds to help them achieve their full potential.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 11 February 2016 to Question 26338 on EU grants and loans on what the £71 million European Social Fund monies have been spent.,For the period December 2013 to July 2015 (2007-2013 European Social Fund programme extended to 2015) European Social Fund monies were used to support young people aged 14-19 who were not in education employment or training or who were at risk of being so to remain in or re-engage in education employment and training. Providers who were contracted to deliver support to young people were required to do so through delivery of activities designed to help young people gain a greater understanding of their own abilities learning needs and the range of opportunities available with the establishment of clear progression routes for the young people concerned. Providers were also required to deliver innovative programmes to give young people experience of success in learning and increase their commitment and motivation to achieve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the cost to school budgets of (a) pupil mobility (b) staff turnover (c) pupils not speaking English at home and (d) pupils with special educational needs.,We recently published our consultations on national funding formulae for schools and high needs funding. A national funding formula will put an end to currently unfair arrangements where children with the same needs attract different amounts of money simply because of where they live. We believe that the national funding formula should target funding to pupils who are likely to face additional barriers in realising their potential and are proposing to include additional needs factors including for English as an additional language. For pupils with special educational needs (SEN) we propose that mainstream schools should continue to be responsible for the first £6000 of costs in respect of each of their pupils with SEN and receive top-up funding from the local authority for costs in excess of £6000. Local authorities reported that they will allocate £750m to primary and secondary schools in 2015-16 in the form of top-up funding for pupils with SEN.Under current local funding formulae the total amount allocated to school budgets in relation to pupil mobility is £24m for 2015-16 and for English as an additional language it is £267m. It is for school leaders to determine how best to use their full budget so that all pupils including mobile pupils pupils with English as an additional language and those with special educational needs can reach their full potential.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to identify children who are eligible for free school meals under Pupil Premium funding who are unaware of their eligibility for that funding.,"The provision of a free nutritious meal and the additional funding that free school meal (FSM) pupils attract through the pupil premium means there is a very strong incentive for parents to register for FSM; and the vast majority do so.We know that schools and local authorities have worked hard to encourage all families to register for FSM and the Department has highlighted and disseminated best practice for other schools to use including a model a registration form. This is available on GOV.UK at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-and-pupil-premium-registration-form\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-and-pupil-premium-registration-form</a>The Department is continuing to explore ways of increasing registration rates further."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will take steps to ensure that there is no reduction in the funding of grammar schools as a result of recent changes to funding for pupils aged 16 to 19.,All providers of 16-19 education including school sixth forms sixth form colleges and general FE colleges are funded according to a single national formula. We announced as part of the Spending Review that we will protect the national base rate of £4000 per student for the duration of the parliament. From 2016/17 the large programme uplift will apply which will give a funding uplift of 10 per cent for study programmes of four A levels and 20 per cent for five A levels when at least a grade B in all subjects is gained. Equivalent uplifts will apply to the full level 3 International Baccalaureate and large TechBacc programmes.We set out full details of the funding rates for 16-19 institutions in 2016/17 in January and aim to provide further information on savings that will be required from 2017/18 as soon as possible. We have already announced that we will remove transitional formula protection funding over six years from 2016/17 ensuring sufficient lead-in time for institutions to manage this reduction.  
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government plans to take in response to the findings of the Effective Pre-School Primary and Secondary Education project by the Institute for Education; and what steps the Government plans to take to improve access to high quality early years education.,We know from the findings of the Effective Pre-School Primary and Secondary Education (EPPSE) study that early education has a significant impact on child outcomes and that attending high quality pre-school provision has a positive and long term impact not only on childrens attainment progress but also on their social-behavioural development. We have now invested in a major longitudinal Study of Early Education and Development (SEED) to update evidence from EPPSE and evaluate the effectiveness of the current early education model in England. Evidence from SEED will be used to continue to ensure that all children receive an effective high quality early education experience that prepares them for school and allows them to fulfil their potential; that future investment is targeted correctly and policies are developed in the most effective way. We understand the importance of quality and its impact on childrens outcomes. The Common Inspection Framework recently introduced by Ofsted will give greater clarity coherence and comparability on early years and education settings to parents and providers. The most recent Ofsted early years and childcare inspection report shows that 85% of all providers currently on the Early Years Register were judged &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; for overall effectiveness. This is a 5 percentage point increase on the previous year to 31 August 2014. And as part of our wider reforms we will continue to work in collaboration with the early years sector to further develop our workforce strategy to improve the quality of the early years workforce. This will include a review of progression routes to identify what more can be done to ensure that good quality staff can maximise their potential and forge a successful career within the early years. We want all children regardless of their starting point to have access to high quality early education and childcare as we know this is what makes the difference to outcomes. We are currently funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds worth around £2500 a year per child to parents; and funding 15 hours a week of free childcare for the 40% most disadvantaged two-year-olds worth around £2500 a year per child to parents. We know that the current model is extremely successful with 99% of four-year-olds and 94% of three-year-olds taking up a place. Based on survey data collected from local authorities in the autumn of 2015 it is estimated that 182000 two-year-olds - around 72% of eligible children - have taken up a place on the two-year-old programme. From September 2017 we are introducing 15 hours of free childcare a week for the working parents of three- and four-year olds worth around a further £2500 a year per child Ò on top of the existing early education entitlement.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she has taken to ensure that adequate ring-fenced funding is provided to local authorities so they can successfully deliver the Government's childcare provision targets.,We have already announced over £1bn more for the early years entitlements within the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant by 2019-20 which includes £300m to uplift the funding rate to providers. The increase to the funding rate is based on robust evidence from the Review of the Cost of Childcare. We have made clear our commitment to maximise the amount of this funding which reaches front line childcare providers and will consult on proposals for achieving this as part of our consultation on early years funding reform later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the implications for her policies of the recommendation in the report by Sense Making the Case for Play for play to be included as part of the ministerial brief of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Childcare and Education.,"The Department for Education recognises that play has an important role in supporting all young children to develop and prepare for later learning. The importance of play is already recognised within the early years legislation covered by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Childcare and Educations portfolio.Play is covered in the statutory Early Years Foundation Stage framework and states: Each area of learning and development must be implemented through planned purposeful play and through a mix of adult-led and child-initiated activity. Play is essential for childrens development building their confidence as they learn to explore to think about problems and relate to others. Children learn by leading their own play and by taking part in play which is guided by adults. The framework is available here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2</a>The staff working in early years settings as Early Years Educators (level 3) and Early Years Teachers (graduates) are required to have an understanding of different pedagogical approaches including the role of play in supporting early learning and development. The criteria for the Early Years Educator and standards for Early Years Teacher Status qualifications are set by the department. However it is the responsibility of early years settings to provide play opportunities for their children and pupils including those with special educational needs and disabilities.Ofsted registers childcare provision on the Early Years Register and the General Childcare Register and conducts a regular cycle of inspection to ensure that provision meets the required quality and safety standards.In judging the quality and standards of early years provision Ofsted inspectors must assess the extent to which the learning and care provided by the setting meets the needs of the range of children who attend including the needs of any children who have special educational needs or disabilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of how many schools in (a) rural and (b) non-rural areas will be unable to provide free school meals to qualifying children as a result of the discontinuation of the universal infant free meals small school support grant.,To help small schools with the transition to universal infant free school meals (UIFSM) we have paid them an extra £32.5m over two years on top of general spending on the policy which amounts to around £600m a year. In the recent Spending Review we also protected funding for UIFSM at £2.30 a meal. We are not aware of any school that is unable to meet its statutory obligations to provide free school meals either to its infants or to older children in receipt of qualifying benefits.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential merits of (a) strategic local approaches to play and (b) local authorities submitting regional play strategies to her Department.,"The Department for Education recognises that play has an important role in supporting all young children to develop and prepare for later learning.Play is integral in the early years and is covered in the statutory Early Years Foundation Stage framework which states: ÏEach area of learning and development must be implemented through planned purposeful play and through a mix of adult-led and child-initiated activity. The framework can be found here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2</a>The staff working in early years settings as Early Years Educators (level 3) and Early Years Teachers (graduates) are required to have an understanding different pedagogical approaches including the role of play in supporting early learning and development.

At August 2015 85 per cent of providers on the Early Years Register were rated good or outstanding for overall effectiveness. This is an increase of 11 percentage points since 2012.Local Authorities provide and offer Continuous Professional Development and training to early years settings; some of which may include training on play. However it is not a requirement for local authorities to deliver regional play training as it is already a requirement in the Early Years Foundation Stage to cover play in a setting."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education at what age it is her policy that schools should start providing pupils with careers advice.,The government wants to see improvements to the extent and quality of the careers advice guidance and inspiration that young people receive throughout their education helping them to be better prepared for the world of work and able to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.Getting the chance to meet a wide range of people doing different jobs is particularly important for those children from disadvantaged backgrounds who have few successful role models either at home or in their local communities. Tackling gender stereotypes needs to be done from an early age.The duty to secure independent careers guidance applies to pupils in years 8-13 but the government recognises the importance of exposing pupils to the world of work form an early age. That is why the government welcomes programmes such as Primary Futures that help to broaden the aspirations of young people from an early age. Primary Futures is a national initiative led by the Education and Employers Taskforce and the National Association of Head Teachers which enables volunteers from a wide range of professions to visit primary schools to inspire pupils.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential merits of highlighting play as a key strand of the Government's policy on parenting and life chances.,"The Department for Education recognises that play has an important role in supporting all young children to develop and prepare for later learning.Play is integral in the early years and is covered in the statutory Early Years Foundation Stage framework which states: <em>ÏPlay is essential for childrens development building their confidence as they learn to explore to think about problems and relate to others. </em>The framework is attached and available on GOV.UK at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2</a>The Governments forthcoming Life Chances Strategy will set out a comprehensive plan to fight disadvantage and extend opportunity. Within this we are considering how we can support early years and parenting to give children the best start in life."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will provide ring-fenced funding to local authorities to ensure they can effectively meet the Government's childcare provision targets.,We have already announced over £1bn more for the early years entitlements within the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant by 2019-20 which includes £300m to uplift the funding rate to providers. The increase to the funding rate is based on robust evidence from the Review of the Cost of Childcare. We have made clear our commitment to maximise the amount of this funding which reaches front line childcare providers and will consult on proposals for achieving this as part of our consultation on early years funding reform later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the implications for her policies of the recommendations in the charity Sense's report entitled Making the Case for Play for play to be included as part of the ministerial brief for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Childcare and Education.,"The Department for Education recognises that play has an important role in supporting all young children to develop and prepare for later learning. The importance of play is already recognised within the early years legislation covered by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Childcare and Educations portfolio.Play is covered in the statutory Early Years Foundation Stage framework and states: ÏEach area of learning and development must be implemented through planned purposeful play and through a mix of adult-led and child-initiated activity. The framework can be found here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2</a>Staff working in early years settings as Early Years Educators (level 3) and Early Years Teachers (graduates) are required to have an understanding of different pedagogical approaches including the role of play in supporting early learning and development.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she has taken to ensure there is adequate funding for children with special educational needs in early years education.,We have already announced over £1bn more for the early years entitlements within the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant by 2019-20 which includes £300m to uplift the funding rate to providers. We are also providing protection for high needs funding that will make sure that the level of funding rises in proportion to the number of children including those under 5. This will make sure that local authorities continue to have the flexibility to target funding where it is most needed to help children with special educational needs and disabilities and their families including the youngest children. Further consideration will be given to funding for children with special educational needs in early years education as part of consultation later this year.Local authorities are required by law to secure free entitlement places for parents that want their child to take them up. The Government is committed to ensuring that all families have access to high quality flexible and affordable childcare and parents with children with special educational needs should have the same opportunities as other parents through access to high quality childcare. The Children and Families Act requires local authorities to have a ÷local offer which includes a statement on how they intend to tailor the childcare on offer for children with special educational needs and disabilities. Early implementation of 30 hours from September 2016 provides a real opportunity to develop innovative approaches to providing flexible childcare for working parents whose children are disabled or have special educational needs.Through Early Implementation York Northumberland Newham and Wigan are among 8 LAs delivering the 30 hours entitlement from September 2016 a year earlier than planned. This will include delivering targeted places focusing on children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.They will also be supported by Early Implementer Innovator areas including Brighton and Hove Hampshire and Trafford who will test the offer and how it works under specific circumstances including developing approaches to support children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government is taking to ensure that local authorities have the (a) financial and (b) other capacity to deliver free childcare to those people who are most deprived.,Since September 2014 around 40% of disadvantaged two-year-olds have been entitled to an early education place. In 2012 the Government contracted ÷Achieving 2-year-olds to support local authorities in expanding the two-year-old entitlement. This support is working and data from the latest voluntary survey of local authorities shows that an estimated 182000 children were funded during the seven week period in the autumn of 2015 as take-up of the entitlement has increased to 72% of eligible children. This is building on local authorities successful delivery of 15 hours of early education per week to all three- and four-year olds with 99% of four-year-olds and 94% of three-year-olds taking up a place.The Government is investing in childcare at record levels and total Government spend on childcare will increase from £5 billion in 2015-16 to over £6 billion by 2019-20. This includes almost £4 billion for the current free entitlement for three- and four-year-olds disadvantaged two-year-olds and the early years pupil premium for three- and four-year-olds as well as funding for the extended entitlement for working parents of three- and four-year-olds. The funding also includes £300 million for a significant uplift to the rate paid for the two three and four-year-old entitlements including for children from deprived backgrounds.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government is taking to promote good mental health among teachers and students.,Good mental health and wellbeing is a key priority for this Government. We have high aspirations for all children and want them to be able to fulfil their potential. Schools should consider how to provide appropriate support to students and staff along with good teaching to support pupil attainment. We want schools to be able to decide on the best way to do this given their individual circumstances. One of the best ways is as part of a ÷whole-school approach. We have taken a range of actions to support them.We have recently revised and updated our counselling guidance which provides practical evidence-based advice informed by experts on how to ensure school based counselling services achieve the best outcomes for all students including vulnerable children and young people. Having this provision in schools also provides support for teaching staff as they are able to easily and quickly get advice from the counsellor about issues that they are concerned about.We have also provided schools with other resources including: guidance and age-appropriate lesson plans on teaching mental health in PSHE; guidance on mental health and behaviour; and MindEd a free online portal which has been developed to enable all adults working with children and young people learn more about specific mental health problems and how to support them.We are providing opportunities to help young people support each other effectively. We recently launched a suite of peer support activities which includes a call for evidence for stakeholders children and young people and funding of up to £1.5m. This includes a new digital innovation fund to develop online reliable engaging and trusted advice to help young people understand their own and their peers mental health.In addition we are contributing to a £3m joint pilot with NHS England which is testing how single points of contact in CAMHS and schools can secure effective mental health support to pupils.We are also working closely with the Department of Health on a national campaign to reduce stigma and raise awareness of mental health issues amongst parents and children which includes resources for schools.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what her Department's policy is on Work Coaches working in schools.,The Government has pledged to introduce demand-led Jobcentre Plus staff to supplement careers guidance and help schools deliver their statutory duty to provide high-quality independent and impartial careers advice.As part of the ÷Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools initiative introduced by the Department for Work and Pensions local Jobcentre Plus advisors will work with schools to help offer 12 to 18 year old pupils insight into the world of work and advise on options such as traineeships and apprenticeships. This scheme is directed particularly at those students at risk of becoming NEET (not in employment education or training) or who may otherwise be disadvantaged in the labour market.This support will be aligned with The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company Enterprise Adviser Network (or other local structures) to avoid adding complexity to the careers landscape for schools and will be delivered initially as a pathfinder in 10 areas. This pathfinder phase started in Birmingham in January 2016.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 29 February 2016 to Question 28207 how many and which local authorities have notified her Department about plans to dispose of grant-funded assets through the (a) sale (b) transfer and (c) change of use of children's centres.,The decision whether to dispose of grant funded assets is a local issue. We have a thorough process in place to consider whether the local authority should be subject to claw back as a result of the disposal of grant funded assets which was outlined in the response to Question 28207.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government is taking to encourage discussions between business leaders and the education sector on improving young people's readiness for work and their future employment prospects.,The Government is taking a number of steps to encourage discussions between business leaders and the education sector.We have provided funding for The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company which is increasing the number and quality of links between the education and business sector. The Companys national network of enterprise advisers is already brokering relationships in 30 LEP areas working with schools colleges employers and careers and enterprise organisations. The Governments forthcoming careers strategy will set out the additional steps we will take to encourage interaction between business leaders and the education sector to support young people to prepare for working life.My Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister in his speech on life chances on 11 January announced £70 million funding over the parliament to transform the quality of the careers education advice and guidance offered to young people. It will include funding for The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company to continue the excellent work it has begun. It will also include delivery of a campaign to recruit a new generation of mentors to support young people at risk of under-achieving or dropping out many of who will be business people.We are also planning reforms to technical education which will ensure that the skills system is simple and genuinely owned understood and valued by employers.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect on Ofsted's budget of the expansion of Ofsted's control over early years inspectors.,Ofsteds budget like those of all government departments was considered as part of the spending review in 2015. Their settlement will be published in due course.As Ofsted are an independent non-ministerial government department it is accountable for its own budget and operational decisions including how to deploy and contract inspection resources.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on Ofsteds operational or commercial matters.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many summer school programmes there were for disadvantaged students transitioning from primary to secondary school in (a) 2014 and (b) 2015.,In 2014 approximately 2121 secondary schools received summer school grant funding. This figure rose to 2259 in 2015.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make an assessment of the potential effect on disadvantaged students of the Education Funding Agency discontinuing funding for summer school programmes.,The recent Spending Review confirmed that we will protect the pupil premium at its current rates for the duration of this Parliament so that schools will continue to attract additional funding for their disadvantaged pupils. To achieve this settlement for schools we have had to make difficult decisions about a number of smaller grants. The grant for the summer schools programme will therefore not continue next financial year. Secondary schools can continue to run a summer school if they wish to and will be able to use their pupil premium allocation to fund places for their disadvantaged pupils.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education when the consultation on a national school funding formula will begin.,The spending review announced our commitment to making school funding fairer by introducing a National Funding Formula for schools. Implementing such a large scale reform of the distribution of over £40 billion of education funding is a detailed and complex issue and one we must get right. It is paramount that we consult with the public and sector and we will set out and consult on our detailed plans for a National Funding Formula in due course.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government is taking in schools to help young people spot the signs of mental illness.,Good mental health and wellbeing is a key priority for this Department. Young people have told us they would like to have opportunities to support each other and help to do this effectively.We recently launched a suite of peer support activities which include a call for evidence for stakeholders and children and young people and funding of up to £1.5m including a new digital innovation fund to develop reliable engaging and trusted advice online to help them understand both their own and their friends mental health.We will also be working with a core steering group and wider advisory group of sector experts including headteachers youth leaders and charities to look at what works in peer support and how young people can strengthen their own networks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that children from the poorest families have not fallen behind their peers when they start school.,We want every child regardless of birth or background to fulfil their full potential. Good quality early education can positively affect a childs later attainment which is why local authorities in England have a legal duty to ensure all three- and four-year-olds and the most disadvantaged two-year-olds are able to take up a funded early education place free of charge.Each eligible child is entitled to 570 hours of free early learning a year equivalent to 15 hours a week of early education for 38 weeks per year. Government figures show 99% of four-year-olds and 96% of three-year-olds are accessing free childcare. Survey findings also indicate 70% of disadvantaged two year-olds are taking up the offer.The early years pupil premium which was introduced in April last year provides nurseries and schools delivering the early education entitlement for three- and four-year-olds with an extra 53p an hour for each eligible child to help them improve the outcomes of disadvantaged children and close the gap in school readiness between disadvantaged children and their peers.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent representations she has received from (a) schools and (b) local authorities on the efficacy of the indicators of deprivation used to calculate formulae for schools.,Children from disadvantaged backgrounds often need extra support at school to achieve as well as their peers. That is why in addition to providing £2.5 billion this year through the pupil premium - which we have protected at current rates for the duration of the parliament - we also require local authorities to target funding for deprived pupils through their local formula.Under current arrangements local authorities can choose between a pupil-level measure of disadvantage (pupils eligible for free school meals or eligible at any point in the previous 6 years) or an area-level measure of disadvantage (the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index) or a combination. We are aware that the update to the area-level deprivation data last year led to some areas changing their local formulae to mitigate the impact on deprivation funding for their schools.We recently launched the first stage of the consultation on our plans to introduce a national funding formula for schools from 2017. Our proposals would mean schools funding is matched fairly and transparently to their needs and their pupils characteristics. Through the consultation process we are seeking views on the best way to target funding for disadvantaged pupils to support them to achieve to the best of their ability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to tackle the level of mental illness among primary and secondary school children.,We have high aspirations for all children and want them to be able to fulfil their potential both academically and in terms of their mental wellbeing. This attainment is best supported if they have good mental health character and resilience. Schools can play an important role in promoting good mental wellbeing and in responding to issues that arise.To support them in doing this we have funded the PSHE Association to provide guidance and lesson plans which support age-appropriate teaching of mental health issues. We have also revised and updated our counselling guidance for schools to include a section on vulnerable children and what schools may need to do to make counselling accessible to them.The department recently launched activity to identify how to help young people help their friends to talk about mental health issues including a call for evidence for stakeholders and children and young people. We also announced funding of up to £1.5m for projects to take this forward once the call for evidence is complete including a new digital innovation fund to develop reliable engaging and trusted advice online to help them understand both their own and their friends mental health.Schools need support from specialist services locally to ensure that pupils with mental illness get the support they need. That is why the Government is investing an additional £1.4bn in childrens mental health this Parliament. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across the country have worked with partners including schools and colleges to produce local transformation plans for children and young peoples mental health services. These should set out what will be done locally to make the best use of the resources available Ò changing how CAMHS is delivered in response to the challenges set out in the Future in Mind report.In addition we are contributing to a £3m joint pilot with NHS England which is testing how single points of contact in CAMHS and schools can secure effective mental health support to pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many and which local authorities have notified her Department about plans to dispose of grant-funded assets through the (a) sale (b) transfer and (c) change of use of children's centres under the requirements of the Sure Start Early Years and Childcare Grant.,Where local authorities dispose of or change the use of buildings or other assets funded wholly or partly through Sure Start capital grants they must repay the money through the claw-back process.The Department for Education has a thorough set of monitoring arrangements in place regarding claw-back rules. Local authorities are required to notify the department of each and every proposed change of services and provide details about the level of early years services that are to continue. The department then considers if the local authority has continued to offer a sufficient level of early years services for children and their families from the building in question to meet the original aims of the grant.If the department is satisfied that the funding for the asset will continue to be used for purposes consistent with the grant the department may defer claw-back. Deferring claw-back means that we accept the change of usage at that time however the department retains its interest in the asset and if in the future the asset has its usage changed is transferred or otherwise disposed of and does not continue to meet the purposes of the grant the local authority must inform the department and we will claw-back the funding. The departments interest in an asset funded by Sure Start capital grants is 25 years from designation of the building. If the grant was used to purchase capital items or re-furbish an existing asset the length of time and value of any claw-back depends on the depreciation value of the items according to local authority depreciation rules.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what criteria her Department uses to assess whether a local authority should be subject to a Sure Start claw-back.,Where local authorities dispose of or change the use of buildings or other assets funded wholly or partly through Sure Start capital grants they must repay the money through the claw-back process.The Department for Education has a thorough set of monitoring arrangements in place regarding claw-back rules.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department has plans to adjust the eligibility criteria for claiming free childcare so that it can be claimed from the child's third birthday rather than from the next term date after the child turns three.,Three year old children become eligible for a government funded early education place from 1 September 1 January or 1 April following their third birthday or the beginning of the autumn spring or summer school term if this is later. These dates mirror those for compulsory school age which is the beginning of the term following a childs fifth birthday. This is intended to ensure that all three year old children can access two years of funded early education and/or maintained school reception provision before they reach compulsory school age.The most disadvantaged two year olds are eligible for a government funded early education place from 1 September 1 January or 1 April following their third birthday or the beginning of the autumn spring or summer school term if this is later.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether school funding for (a) inner London boroughs and (b) outer London boroughs will decrease in the next financial year.,I can assure my Hon Friend that per pupil funding for a) inner London boroughs and b) outer London boroughs will not decline in the next financial year. The dedicated schools grant schools block is maintained at cash flat per pupil for the 2016 to 2017 financial year for all local authorities. In addition the pupil premium is also maintained at the current per pupil amounts for the 2016 to 2017 financial year. As announced in the Chancellors spending review statement we will introduce a national funding formula from 2017. We will consult on proposals later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 11 February 2016 to Question 25621 if her Department will publish that part of the small schools taskforce report which is not already in the public domain.,We do not have any plans to publish anything further beyond the toolkit for small schools which was made available to schools last year. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will estimate the change in that part of her Department's budget which is allocated to free school meals that will result from discontinuation of universal infant free school meals; and whether such a change would trigger a consequential change in the payment to devolved administrations under the Barnett formula.,Universal infant free school meals have been a great success with over 1.3 million additional infants enjoying a nutritious free meal at lunchtime and parents saving hundreds of pounds a year. The Chancellor made it clear at the spending review in the autumn that in line with the Conservative Partys manifesto commitment this policy will be protected for the duration of the Parliament. It costs around £600 million a year in England with proportionate funding going to the devolved administrations under the Barnett formula.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the cost has been of provision of free school meals by region in each of the last three years.,"Schools in England fund free school meals out of the overall resources available to them. Since September 2014 all infant pupils in maintained schools in England have been entitled to free school meals regardless of parental income.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make applications for EU structural funds for the purposes of alleviating pressure on school places caused by migration from other EU countries.,The Government has no plans to make applications for EU structural funds to support investment in additional school places.We have committed £23 billion to create 600000 new school places open 500 new free schools and address essential maintenance needs between 2016 and 2021. This includes sufficient funding to create the places required between now and the 2021/22 academic year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the financial effect of the provision of the Childcare Bill on primary schools with nursery provision.,The Childcare Bill delivers the governments election manifesto commitment to give families where parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three- and four-year olds. Alongside other providers primary schools including free schools and academies will play an important role in the delivery of this new entitlement from September 2017.Getting the funding right is essential for successful delivery. Together with the funding announced at Summer Budget we will be investing over £1 billion per year by 2019-20 to fund this manifesto pledge. The funding includes £300 million for a significant uplift to the rate paid for the two- three- and four-year old entitlements. We are also investing at least £50 million of capital funding to create additional places in nurseries and estimate a further 4000 places will be created through new Free Schools.The government acknowledges that not all schools will be able to offer the full 30 hours entitlement themselves. Where that is the case partnerships between schools and other providers such as childminders will allow parents to access their entitlement through their school. Partnerships like this already exist and we will be drawing out lessons learned and good practice from them in order to help others to establish their own partnerships for the delivery of the 30 hours entitlement.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what proportion of (a) primary and (b) secondary school budgets have been spent on tackling mental health problems in each of the last five years; and if the Government will take steps to protect such spending in future.,The most recent prevalence survey estimated that 1 in 10 children have a diagnosable mental health disorder and more have lower level problems. This is why the Government has made good mental health character and resilience a high priority. The Department of Health is commissioning a new prevalence survey to update this estimate for a wider range of ages from 2-19. It is due to report in 2018. We do not routinely collect data that allows us to measure the amount schools spend specifically on addressing mental health issues.We are committed to better understanding what schools are doing on this matter which is why my department is commissioning an extensive survey. This survey will provide a robust national picture of mental health support provided by schools and colleges.It is for head teachers to determine how they spend their individual school budgets to best meet the needs of all their pupils. In the Spending Review we announced that the core schools budget will be protected in real terms through this Parliament. We are also protecting the Pupil Premium which many schools use to fund mental health provision at current pupil rates. Within these protections we announced in December 2015 that an additional £92.5 million will specifically be provided in the high needs element of the Dedicated School Grant (DSG) next year.We have also made £1.4 billion available over the next five years to transform local children and young peoples mental health services to deliver more integrated and accessible services. Clinical Commissioning Groups have been required to work with others services locally including schools to produce plans that set out how they will transform children and young peoples mental health services locally to make them more accessible and increase the focus on prevention.We are also contributing to a £3 million joint pilot with NHS England for training single points of contact in schools and specialist mental health services to ensure that children and young people have timely access to specialist support where needed. There are 22 pilot areas covering more than 200 schools across 27 CCGs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of super centres on smaller privately-funded child care businesses located close to them.,There is a duty on local authorities to judge what provision is appropriate to meet local needs in their areas. An overarching statutory framework places a legal duty on local authorities to have arrangements in place to secure sufficient childrens centres to meet local need and to consult where changes are planned to local childrens centre provision.In deciding what arrangements to make local authorities must have particular regard to the quality and quantity of early childhood services in the area. Local authorities are best placed to understand local needs and the different ways children and families can be supported locally.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the amount of EU funding her Department received in each of the last three years.,For the period December 2013 to July 2015 (2007-2013 European Social Fund programme extended to 2015) £71 million of ring fenced European Social Fund monies was available to provide support for young people aged 14-19 who were not in education employment or training or who were at risk of being so. The funding was administered by the Skills Funding Agency on behalf of the Education Funding Agency.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what additional funding her Department plans to make available to small childcare facilities to help them meet the costs of the proposed free 30 hours of childcare per week.,As part of the Spending Review in November 2015 we announced that we will be investing over £1billion more per year by 2019-20 to fund the governments commitments on the early education entitlements. The funding includes £300 million per year for a significant increase to the rate paid for the two three and four year old entitlements. From April 2017 the national average funding rates will increase to £4.88 for three and four year olds and £5.39 for two year olds. Local authorities are responsible for deciding how to distribute this funding across their area and for setting the rate paid to early years providers.We will introduce a national funding formula for early years so that funding is transparently and fairly matched to need and fairly distributed between different types of providers and different parts of the country. We will be consulting on detailed proposals later this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many paid carers her Department estimates will be eligible for the Government's proposed free 30 hours of childcare.,"The extended entitlement is intended to support working parents with the cost of childcare enabling them to return to work or work additional hours if they wish to do so. Families where both parents work or one parent works in a single parent household will be eligible for these additional hours. In recognition of the particular challenges that paid carers can face in relation to childcare the Childcare Bill allows for parents in certain circumstances to be regarded as being in work for example those parents who have caring responsibilities.Households where one parent is working and one parent is being paid Carers Allowance or Universal Credits Carer Element will be able to access the extended entitlement provided the working parent meets the income eligibility requirements. This includes households where a parent is caring for their own three or four year old child where the child is in receipt of Disability Living Allowance or is certified blind.In relation to single parents with a disabled child where that parent meets the income eligibility requirements they will also be able to access the extended entitlement. Parents who do not work will continue to receive Carers Allowance or Universal Credit.It is also important to remember that all paid carers will be able to access the existing 15 hour early education entitlement for three and four year olds and the 15 hour early education entitlement for two year olds if they meet the eligibility criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many kinship carers her Department estimates will be eligible for the Government's proposed free 30 hours of childcare.,Kinship carers will be able to access the existing 15 hour early education entitlement for any three and four year old children in their care. In addition two year olds who are looked after by a local council or have left care under a special guardianship order child arrangements order or adoption order are entitled to 15 hours per week of early education.In respect of the extended entitlement for three and four year olds kinship carers who have parental responsibility for the child will be able to access the extended entitlement provided that they are earning the equivalent to 16 hours a week at National Minimum or Living Wage and their income does not exceed £100000. This includes employed and self-employed kinship carers.The Department does not hold information on the number of kinship carers who would meet the income eligibility criteria and who have three or four year old children.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans her Department has for the implementation of the recommendations in the School Food Plan (SFP) after the end of the SFP office's contract with her Department at the end of March 2016.,Actions from the School Food Plan include significant lasting achievements such as cooking in the national curriculum and the implementation of a set of new school food standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department has taken to consult with (a) nurseries and (b) other stakeholders on the development of the childcare workforce strategy.,The government has committed to develop a workforce strategy in 2016 and remains committed to engage with stakeholders in the sector on elements of the strategy. We regularly speak at conferences to talk about the workforce. It is our intention to consult with a range of stakeholders including early years providers such as nurseries and we are currently considering the best course of action to pursue this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans she has to improve food hygiene safety in schools children's clubs and nurseries that failed to meet satisfactory standards in inspections last year.,Local authorities are responsible for food hygiene inspections of schools childrens clubs and nurseries at which food is served regularly to children. Food hygiene legislation requires these premises to be registered as food businesses. The Food Standards Agency which sets policy for and monitors enforcement of food safety legislation by local authorities has advised that approximately 99% of educational establishments and caring establishments including schools childrens clubs and nurseries have satisfactory or better food hygiene standards.Local authorities work with food businesses to make improvements in any premises that fail to meet satisfactory standards during inspections and may take a range of enforcement actions as considered appropriate in the circumstances of each case. The honourable member for Bolton North East or members of his constituency may contact the relevant local authority or the Food Standards Agency for detailed information about specific premises that are of concern to him.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment she has made of the quality of early education and childcare available to disadvantaged children.,The Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the standards for the provision of learning development and care for children from birth to age five. The EYFS helps early years providers to prepare young children for school and improve their life chances by delivering high quality early education.The most recent EYFS Profile results show that the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers has narrowed - 51% of children eligible for free school meals (FSM) achieved a good level of development (GLD) in 2015 compared to 45% in 2014. This is the equivalent of an extra 5800 children eligible for FSM achieving a GLD.We want all children regardless of their starting point to have access to high quality early education and childcare as we know this is what makes the difference to outcomes. To help close the gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers we introduced the early learning programme for two-year-olds in September 2013. Around 160000 of our most disadvantaged two-year-olds are already benefiting.We have also introduced the Early Years Pupil Premium worth £50 million a year. This provides nurseries and schools delivering the early education entitlement with an extra 53p an hour for disadvantaged three and four year olds to help them close the gap in school readiness. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to improve the quality of early years education.,The Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the standards for the provision of learning development and care for children from birth to age five which all early years providers must follow. All three- and four-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours a week of quality early education free of charge to prepare them for school and improve their life chances. 94% of three- and 99% of four-year-olds are taking up the current free entitlement.The latest Early Years Foundation Stage Profile data reveal that an increasing proportion of children are achieving a good level of development at age five: 66% in 2015 compared to 52% in 2013. This is an impressive increase in the last two years.The quality of the workforce is key to the quality of early years provision and to the positive outcomes it delivers for childrens long term life chances. In group full day care settings 87% of the workforce has a relevant qualification at level 3. Many of the workforce are qualified beyond level 3. Since 2007 over 16000 individuals have achieved Early Years Professional Status and Early Years Teacher Status.We will continue to grow a high quality workforce to drive improvement across the sector through our Workforce Strategy. The strategy will consider how career progression in the sector can be improved to attract and retain quality staff and how effective continuing professional development can help settings to deliver the best quality provision they can.The government is committed to supporting parents with high childcare costs and is investing in childcare at record levels. By 2019-20 we will be spending more than £6 billion on early years and childcare. The Childcare Bill is delivering the governments election manifesto commitment to giving families where parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of how many eligible pupils did not claim free school meals in each of the last three years.,The Department only collects data on those eligible pupils who claim free school meals. To collect the data on pupils who did not claim free school meals could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many Sure Start centres are due to be closed over the current Parliament.,The Department does not routinely collect data on the number of anticipated childrens centre closures but expects local authorities to fulfil their duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure sufficient childrens centres to meet the needs of local families. Local authorities must consult fully before any significant changes are made to childrens centre services.

We also continue to invest in the Early Years Pupil Premium.We are introducing Tax-Free Childcare from early 2017 under which around 2 million families could benefit by up to £2000 per child per year or £4000 per child per year if a child is disabled.For working parents on low and middle incomes working tax credit pays up to 70% of their childcare costs and this will increase to 85% under Universal Credit from April 2016. This support will be available for the first time to those working fewer than 16 hours per week.<br />[1] <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013</a>[2] <a href=\""http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015</a>[3] <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-childcare-response-to-the-select-committee-report\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-childcare-response-to-the-select-committee-report</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what representations she has received from business organisations on the quality of careers information advice and guidance in (a) Lambeth and (b) Southwark; and how she has responded to those representations.,We have engaged with many employers and their representative bodies including the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce on the subject of careers education and guidance for young people. We are not aware of any specific representations on the quality of careers provision in Lambeth and Southwark.We want to spread excellent practice in careers education and employer engagement across the country so that every young person regardless of background can access the inspiration and guidance they need to prepare for working life. ÷London Ambitions is a great example of a collaborative approach which will transform the landscape of careers and employment support for young people in Lambeth Southwark and other London boroughs. Commissioned through the London Enterprise Panel and London Councils the reports recommendations include at least 100 hours of experience of the world of work by the age of 16 comprehensive up-to-date information on the jobs market in the capital and a ÷London Ambitions Careers Curriculum to help young people link their learning experiences to future success in the workplace.At a national level we have established The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company which is connecting employees from firms of all sizes to schools through a network of enterprise advisers drawn from business volunteers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans the Government has to improve employment and careers advice.,The Government has introduced a number of measures to improve employment and careers advice. We have established The Careers &amp; Enterprise Company (CEC) to strengthen links between employers schools and colleges and careers and enterprise organisations to inspire young people and help them take control of their own futures. The CEC is rolling out the Enterprise Adviser Network which connects employees from firms of all sizes to schools through a network of volunteer enterprise advisers. The Company has also launched its £5m Careers &amp; Enterprise Fund to scale up good ideas and fill gaps in provision.The Prime Minister recently announced a new campaign to encourage a new generation of high quality mentors. The campaign which will be led by the CEC will aim to increase the number of business and professional mentors working with teenagers who are under-achieving or at risk of dropping out of education.The Government is also introducing a new initiative which will see Jobcentre Plus staff offer support where schools request it to supplement careers guidance and to help schools deliver their statutory duty to provide high quality independent and impartial careers advice. Jobcentre Plus staff will focus support on those students at risk of not participating in education employment or training. The scheme will be aligned with the CECs Enterprise Adviser network and will be rolled out later this academic year.Building on these measures we want to go further to improve careers education and guidance for all young people. We will launch a careers strategy in the spring of 2016 which will set out the governments vision for careers education and how we will get there by 2020.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential effect on school budgets of the National Living Wage.,We want to reward people in work so we are introducing a national living wage in April 2016 which raises the current minimum rate by 50p per hour. Over a million workers will benefit directly from the increase many by up to £900 a year.Some of those workers are employed in our schools. We will be expecting schools like all employers to manage the change within their budgets. To help them do that we have protected the core schools budget including the pupil premium and we have ensured that the extra £390 million allocated in 2015-16 remains in the baseline for future years. Throughout this Parliament we will increase the amount of money for our schools as pupil numbers rise protecting the total budget in real terms.We have committed to target this funding more fairly by introducing a national funding formula. With a fair formula we will be able to fund schools based on their individual needs so that they can manage cost pressures effectively and make informed decisions about what is best for them and their pupils in the long term. This fairer system will mean schools can keep driving up educational standards while managing their budgets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will change the funding for school children who receive their education outside of their own area in order to enable the funding to follow the pupil.,We are committed to fairer school funding where the money our schools receive matches their pupils needs. At the Spending Review alongside protecting the schools budget in real terms we announced our intention to deliver this by introducing a national funding formula for schools in 2017. That will mean children attract funding based on their individual characteristics and not where they live or whether the schools they attend are situated in other local authority areas. The amount of money following each pupil will be clear and funding levels across the country will be transparent and fair. These are significant reforms and we will consult extensively in the New Year to ensure we get them right and to provide clarity and security for schools.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many and which local authorities have returned childcare grant funding to the Exchequer in each of the last five financial years.,Funding to local authorities for the early years entitlement for two three and four-year-olds is made via the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG).

We will set out our detailed proposals and consult extensively in the new year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to help prevent loneliness and social isolation among younger people.,"Loneliness and isolation in younger people may be due to a variety of complex reasons and there is no single solution; prevention and early intervention are key. The Department for Educations provisions for early years schools and vulnerable children all play a part in promoting social contact and assisting families to support children more effectively.<br />Schools can play a significant role in promoting good mental health and emotional wellbeing which helps their pupils integrate and get the most out of the education by supporting children and young people who are facing difficulties. Every state-funded school in England must offer a broad and balanced curriculum which promotes the spiritual moral cultural and physical development of pupils. In doing so we expect schools to make provision for personal social health and economic education (PSHE) and to provide a wide range of curricular and extra-curricular opportunities for pupils to develop their character.<br />When loneliness and isolation leads to mental health difficulties there is a range of support available to schools. Our Mental Health and Behaviour advice helps teachers to identify and support pupils with mental health needs including being aware of when children become withdrawn and isolated: <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a>.

On top of this the Department for Education is also providing funding worth £4.9 million this year through a dedicated mental health strand within our VCS programme which includes supporting children and young people with issues such as bereavement. For those children and young people with caring responsibility who are particularly at risk of isolation we have changed the law to make it easier for them to get an assessment of their needs for support regardless of the level or type of care they provide."""

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of poor mental health on the education outcomes of children up to 18 years old.,An estimated 1 in 10 children have a diagnosable mental health disorder and more have lower level problems. We know that all forms of mental health disorder in children are associated with disruption to education and absence from school. We also know there is a strong association between conduct disorders in adolescence and a lack of qualifications in early adulthood.<br />This is why the government has made good mental health character and resilience a high priority. We want all children and young people to be able to fulfil their potential both academically and in terms of their mental wellbeing. The Department of Health has committed an additional £1.4 billion of funding which will be used to help radically improve mental health services for children young people and new mothers over the next 5 years.<br />Schools and colleges have an important role to play in supporting the resilience and mental health of children and young people. To support schools develop approaches that suit the particular needs of their students we have:<ul>contributed £1.5 million to a joint pilot for training single points of contact in schools and specialist mental health services to ensure that children and young people have timely access to specialist support where needed;funded guidance and lesson plans to support age-appropriate teaching about mental health;published guidance on the provision of high quality counselling in schools and mental health and behaviour;provided funding worth £4.9 million this year through a dedicated mental health strand within our VCS programme to support 17 projects delivering a wide range of support across the country to children and young people with mental health issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what modelling her Department has undertaken of the potential effect of freezing her Department's budget in cash terms on (a) educational outcomes and (b) pupil wellbeing.,<br />We are protecting the schools budget in real terms as we pledged in our manifesto. Throughout this Parliament the amount of money for our schools will increase as pupil numbers rise. In 2015-16 we increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local authorities by £390 million and that increased level of funding will be included in the baseline for future years. We will go further to target funding effectively and end historic unfairness in the system by introducing a national funding formula. We will provide every school with a fair allocation matched to need that allows them to continue driving up educational standards and support every child to achieve to the best of their potential whatever their background and wherever they live.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the potential effect of the Government's proposed reductions in tax credits on the pupil premium.,As my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor announced on 25 November the government is not proceeding with the changes to the tax credit threshold and taper announced at the Summer Budget 2015.<br />We are determined to deliver educational excellence everywhere so that every child regardless of background reaches their potential. That is why we are delivering on our commitment to continue providing the pupil premium protected at current rates so schools receive additional money for pupils from the poorest backgrounds.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department is undertaking of the effect on children's (a) attainment (b) health and (c) attendance of the universal infant free school meals policy.,The decision to introduce universal infant free school meals (UIFSM) was based on pilots of universal free school meals carried out between 2009 and 2011 in Newham and Durham. The pilots demonstrated benefits in terms of childrens health attainment and behaviour as well as helping families with the cost of living.<br />The UIFSM policy has been in place for just over a year. We will look carefully at a range of indicators in relation to UIFSM once we are satisfied that we have sufficient time series data to undertake a robust analysis.<br />

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to ensure that schools facilitate highly-able pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds accessing the best universities.,Widening participation in higher education (HE) is a priority for this government building on the real progress being made in the last 5 years. In England the entry rates for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds were at record levels in 2014 rising from 13.6 per cent in 2009 to 18.2 per cent in 2014. Applications from this group also reached a record high in 2015 with the latest data showing a 21 per cent application rate. As set out in the Green Paper on Higher Education published on 6 November this government has set a goal to double the proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering HE by the end of this Parliament from 2009 levels. Schools have a critical role in delivering on this commitment.We have introduced compulsory study of the key English Baccalaureate subjects to make sure more pupils get the rigorous academic education they need to succeed in getting a place at university.We are also committed to continuing the pupil premium protected at current rates so that pupils from the poorest backgrounds get the help they need including the most able.Work is underway to implement collaborative national networks that will provide single points of contact to help teachers and advisers to find out about HE outreach activity in their area and give general advice about progression to HE. A total of £22 million is being provided in 2014-16 and 35 networks will cover schools across England.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what progress is being made on the implementation of 30 hours of free childcare for working parents.,"On 1 June 2015 the government introduced a Bill to create a new entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds.The entitlement is on track to be implemented early for some families in some areas from September 2016 with full roll-out across England from September 2017.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education when the Government plans to respond to the First Report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Affordable Childcare Session 2014-15 HL Paper 117.,During the passage of the Childcare Bill we committed to writing to members of the House of Lords Affordable Childcare Select Committee with a response to their report. We will do so shortly. At the appropriate time we will place copies of the response in the libraries of both Houses.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy to maintain the current staff-child ratio for childcare providers and child minders until 2020.,There are no plans to change the staff:child ratios for providers registered on the Early Years Register. Lord Nash made clear during passage of the Childcare Bill in the House of Lords that we are committed to keeping the existing ratios.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department plans to change the rules on staff-pupil ratios in early education settings.,There are no plans to change the staff: child ratios for providers registered on the Early Years Register. Lord Nash made clear during passage of the Childcare Bill in the House of Lords that we are committed to keeping the existing ratios.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans her Department has to increase the number of early education places for children (a) under the age of three and (b) aged three and four; and if she will make a statement.,We have already made significant progress in ensuring that there are more childcare places available. There has been an increase of 230000 places since 2009 and a significant increase in the take up of childcare provision in low- and middle-income areas.<br />This government has also supported providers by reducing bureaucracy and making it easier for providers such as childminders and schools to provide places. We continue to work with providers to increase the number of childcare places for example by sharing good practice on working in partnership.<br />Subject to the will of Parliament the Childcare Bill will introduce an entitlement to 30 hours of funded childcare for working parents of three- and four-year olds from 2017. New childcare places will be required for this age group and the government wishes to encourage new providers to enter the childcare market and existing providers to expand. On top of the steps already being taken such as the extension of the Childcare Business Grant Scheme our planned Early Implementers will test provider capacity and market innovation and flexibility from 2016.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether the Government plans to increase the number of qualified staff working on early education settings.,The extended free childcare entitlement for working parents of three- and four-year-olds will provide eligible parents with 30 hours of free childcare per week. The government provides guidance in the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage which sets out the ratios within which providers must operate. We expect providers to recruit accordingly and that the market will respond to demand in local areas. The childcare market has proven that it is adaptable as demonstrated by the increase of 230000 places since 2009. The timetable for implementation of the extended entitlement ensures that the market has time to expand.<br />The quality of provision is central to ensuring benefits to children and the main driver of quality in a setting is its workforce. The qualification levels of the childcare workforce has risen over recent years and we want the sector to continue to attract highly qualified staff with a strong aptitude for working with young children to deliver good quality childcare.<br />We are taking steps to improve the process for those training to become Early Years Educators and Early Years Teachers. In 2016 the government will review progression routes within the sector to determine what more can be done to enable good quality staff to maximise their potential and forge a successful career within early years. This will build on existing investments in staff training and development that have brought high performing schools and private voluntary and independent providers together to share good practice and improve transition into school for young children.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will discuss with the Treasury the introduction of three-year funding plans for colleges to align with the period of the Spending Review.,16-19 funding is based on the level of recruitment institutions delivered in the previous year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to the Answer of 1 December 2014 to Question 216015 what criteria her Department sets for eligibility for free school meals for households in receipt of universal credit.,Universal Credit is being rolled out in stages and the vast majority of households with children whose parents who are receiving in-work benefits will not transfer to Universal Credit until late 2016. The Department for Education is currently considering how the eligibility rules should change and will consult on proposals ahead of their introduction.While this work is on-going any child whose parent or guardian is receiving Universal Credit will continue to be entitled to free school meals.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps the Government has taken to (a) improve destination data for school leavers and (b) develop online portals to help advise school leavers of all post-16 learning options.,"Information on the destinations of Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 students was published on 20 October 2015. These experimental statistics are available online.[1]The statistics are published at national local constituency and institution level.Since they were first released in 2012 we have added data about employment destinations; improved the coverage by including independent schools special schools pupil referral units and other alternative provision; and have improved the timeliness of the data.

We plan to publish all Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 destinations as headline performance measures in the 2016 performance tables.In our guidance on post-16 funding we set out the expectation that providers of post-16 education and training will add information on their Government funded courses to a national database. The aim is that portal providers will be able to access this information and present it in a user-friendly way to help young people make informed decisions about their options.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to clause 1 of the Childcare Bill what categories of childcare provider she plans to include in an independent review of the free childcare entitlement funding system.,I announced in the summer that a government review of the cost of providing childcare was underway. The review which began well before clause 1 was inserted into the Bill is being led by the Department with external support from Deloitte. Findings from the review will inform decisions made as part of the Spending Review.The government review is considering a significant body of evidence on the provision of childcare across a range of provider types including private voluntary and independent providers childminders and schools. As part of the review we have engaged extensively with providers from across the sector. Our call for evidence received over 2000 responses the majority of which were from providers and our online questionnaire had over 19300 responses. We held a series of roundtables over the summer across the country and have also worked with 10 large employers (including Carillion John Lewis Partnership Rolls Royce and BT) and through them have engaged over 180 parents in a series of events. These have provided a valuable opportunity to engage with providers face to face.<br>
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of increasing free childcare provision to 30 hours per week on the number of nurseries which offer free childcare.,Introducing the new entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for working parents will require growth in the childcare market and the government is confident this will be achieved. Since 2009 230 000 places have been created.<br />It is of course essential that the funding for the entitlement is right to ensure that a sufficient number of nurseries are able to deliver it. The government has already committed to an increase to the average funding rate paid to providers.<br />The governments review on the cost of providing childcare will inform decisions on a rate that is fair and sustainable for providers. Findings from the review will feed directly into the Spending Review which will be published on 25 November.<br /> <br />

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what discussions she has had with headteachers on (a) expanding childcare and (b) developing a right for parents to request that schools provide childcare.,Schools are an important provider of high quality early education and childcare and the government has already improved the regulatory framework and supported schools to help them deliver more places for children. We are actively working with schools and others to identify and share good practice and learning across the system so that more schools can offer flexible full-day nursery provision either themselves or in partnership with others. This work will feed directly into the Early Implementation pilots of the 30 hours entitlement in 2016.As a part of this officials have had a number of discussions with unions including the National Association of Headteachers about the 30 hours entitlement and have met them on the new parental right to request before school after school and holiday childcare for school-aged children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of increasing free childcare provision to 30 hours per week on (a) the number of childcare places (b) child to adult ratios in nursery settings and (c) the number of nurseries which offer free childcare provision.,<br />Introducing the new entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for working parents will require growth in the childcare market which the Government is confident can be achieved. We know that many working families with three- and four-year-olds already use more than 15 hours of childcare so many of the required childcare places already exist. We also believe that there is some existing spare capacity in the system to help deliver the new entitlement. The Government is committed to keeping the existing child to adult ratios and has no plans to change them to deliver the extended entitlement.<br />We have already made significant progress in ensuring that there are more childcare places available with an increase of 230000 places since 2009. Furthermore data from the Childcare and Early Years Provider Survey (2013) showed that 97% of full day care settings that took three and four-year-olds offered funded places. The childcare sector is healthy vibrant and growing. During the last Parliament it demonstrated its ability to respond to the extension of the free entitlement to disadvantaged two-year-olds.<br />

To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 20 October 2015 to Question 11372 how many local authorities have used her Department's eligibility checking system for free school meals.,The departments records indicate that all English local authorities have used the eligibility checking system for free school meals.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 20 October 2015 to Question 11372 how many additional children are now in receipt of free school meals since the changes made to her Department's eligibility checking system.,The eligibility checking system has been revised and updated on a number of occasions for example to reflect that universal credit had been added to the list of entitling benefits in 2012. Since 2010 the number of pupils entitled to and claiming for free school meals has decreased from 1212320 (16.2%) to 1198494 (15.1%) in 2015. We expect the proportion of children eligible for and claiming free school meals to continue to decrease as the economy continues to improve.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 21 October 2015 to Question 12263 what estimate her Department has made of the number of Reception Year 1 and Year 2 pupils who will qualify for free school meals in each of the next five years.,The continuation of free school meals was a commitment in the Conservative Partys election manifesto. The government is currently conducting a spending review across all its programmes. We are not able to report on free school meals until after the outcome of that review.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment she has made of the cost of privately-provided child care; what comparison she has made with the amounts which parents can claim for childcare from the Government; and if she will make a statement.,"The Department for Education uses a range of cost information from a number of difference sources. These sources include our Parents Survey which can be found at <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childcare-and-early-years-survey-of-parents-2012-to-2013</a> and independent surveys such as the Family and Childcare Trust Annual Childcare Cost Survey 2015 which can be found at: <a href=\""http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015</a>We increased funding for childcare by £1 billion last Parliament meaning that we spent £5 billion on childcare in 2014-15. We were the first government to fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds. The funding for all three- and four-year-olds is worth around £2500 a year per child; and the funding for around 40% of two-year-olds is also worth around £2500 a year per child. We are introducing an additional 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds of working families worth a further £2500 a year per child from September 2017.We will be introducing Tax-Free Childcare from early 2017 under which up to 1.8 million working families could benefit by up to £2000 a year per child. For working parents on low and middle incomes working tax credit pays up to 70% of their childcare costs which could be worth up to £6370 for their first child. Under Universal Credit the subsidy rate will increase to 85% of childcare costs and support will be available for the first time to those working fewer than 16 hours per week."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans she has for consistent monitoring of the emotional social and physical development of children in their early years after the Early Years Foundation Profile becomes non-compulsory in September 2016; and if she will make a statement.,It is important for parents and teachers to know how well a child is progressing. As such communication and language physical development and personal social and emotional development are set out in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework as prime learning areas for children from birth to age five.<br />As part of the wider reforms to the accountability system for primary schools and the national curriculum we have introduced the reception baseline assessment for the 2015/16 academic year.<br />The reception baseline forms one part of a teachers wider assessments in reception and we will expect early years practitioners to continue to carry out the appropriate ongoing formative assessment of children of reception age.<br />The EYFS statutory framework will also still require early years practitioners to carry out a progress check against the three prime areas of learning at age two and we are improving this check for parents by bringing it together with health visitor checks in the form of new Integrated Reviews.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many children aged between four and seven in (a) Lewisham Deptford constituency (b) the London Borough of Lewisham and (c) London received free school meals in each of the last five academic years.,"Prior to the 2014/15 academic year the department did not collect data on the number of free school meals given out to pupils below school level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the effects on the worst funded schools of adjusting the percentage applied in the calculation of the Minimum Funding Guarantee.,The minimum funding guarantee protects schools from significant changes in their funding limiting the year-on-year reductions in a schools pupil-led funding to 1.5%.The minimum funding guarantee for schools will continue to be set at minus 1.5% per pupil for 2016-17. We have committed to making funding fairer but we cannot comment on the detail of proposals prior to the outcome of the Spending Review.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what amount of pupil premium paid was not spent in the year it was paid in each of the last four years; what proportion of the total spending on pupil premium that amounted to in each of those years; and what estimate she has made of the total amount of pupil premium carried over in each of those years.,"The department does not collect information from schools and academies on the amounts of the pupil premium spent in any given year nor the amount carried forward to future years.Local Authorities are obliged to provide an annual assurance that all pupil premium funding paid to them has been distributed appropriately. Schools and academies are also required to publish how much pupil premium funding they have received; what they have spent this on; and what impact this has had on the attainment of those pupils under the scope of the grant. This information is published annually on their websites.Whilst we do not collect the specific information requested we do publish the pupil premium allocations themselves and they are available here: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-2015-to-2016-allocations\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-2015-to-2016-allocations</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of the Government's proposed changes to tax credits on the number of children able to access free school meals.,The governments changes to tax credits will have no effect on the number of children accessing free school meals (FSM) in England. All households receiving out-of-work benefits continue to be entitled to FSM while changes to Child Tax Credit will have no impact. The number of children growing up in workless households has decreased by 480000 since 2010 a record low. This has led to the number of households claiming FSM decreasing and we expect this to continue as the economy continues to improve.

From April 2012 the funding has been paid to schools for the number of pupils who have been eligible for FSM at any point in the previous 6 years.<br />Data which split the pupil premium into the primary and secondary phases of education are only available for the deprivation element of the premium. Information on deprivation pupil premium by primary and secondary year groups was first published in 2013/14. Total funding allocations were published for earlier years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential benefits of re-introducing compulsory work experience for under 16 year olds.,We are making the whole education system much more closely linked to the world of work. We have put more emphasis on mastering vital skills more respected qualifications and given employers greater influence over the content of courses so young people have the skills that universities and employers value.<p /> We want more young people to have the opportunity to take part in high quality work experience that helps to prepare them for the workplace and develop the employability skills that employers require. Work experience is an important element of post-16 provision Ò new personalised study programmes include some form of work experience or work-related learning that is relevant to the career aspirations of students.<p /> We recognise that younger children benefit from contact with employers but we trust head teachers to decide what is best for their pupils including when and how to take part in work experience. We are providing valuable support through a new employer-led Careers &amp; Enterprise Company has been tasked with increasing the level of employer input into schools and colleges.<br />

It is for schools to decide how best to fulfil their legal requirements in accordance with the needs of their pupils and online careers advice services may form part of their independent careers provision.   As stated in the statutory guidance the National Careers Service offers information and professional advice about education training and work to adults and young people aged 13 years and over. Pupils and their parents can access support via a website helpline and web chat. The National Careers Service contractors website and helpline advisers all hold and adhere to the governments Matrix Standard the recognised national quality standard for information advice and guidance services. Award of the Standard is contingent on the provision of an impartial professional service. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that children develop good early language skills before they reach primary school.,"The government recognises a key part of raising the standard of education for all children is to ensure they receive a good level of development in literacy and numeracy before they start school. The government has taken the following steps to ensure children are developing good early language skills before they reach primary school:   The Early Years Foundation Stage sets the prime areas of learning which early years providers must follow. This includes a focus on communication and language. The Early Years Foundation Stage requires providers to understand the needs of every child and support them as necessary to make progress. The Early Years Foundation stage is available online at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335504/EYFS_framework_from_1_September_2014__with_clarification_note.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335504/EYFS_framework_from_1_September_2014__with_clarification_note.pdf</a>   The numeracy and literacy skills of staff working with our youngest children are key to supporting childrens progression. We have improved early years qualifications and encouraged high-quality entrants with good numeracy and literacy skills into the profession through setting clear criteria for level 3 training courses and introducing early years initial teacher training.   The government has invested over £50 million funding through the Early Years Pupil premium an additional £5.3 million to sector organisations under the VCS grants and a one off grant of £5 million to teaching schools and their childcare provider partners to support staff development. Many of the projects funded through departmental grants are supporting staff to develop strong pedagogical approaches to language development and early literacy.   """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to ensure that disadvantaged children have access to good quality childcare.,All local authorities in England have a legal duty to ensure all three- and four-year-olds and the most disadvantaged two-year-olds are able to take up a funded early education place free of charge. Each eligible child is entitled to 570 hours of free early learning a year equivalent to 15 hours a week of early education for 38 weeks per year. Settings delivering the funded early education entitlement are subject to inspection by Ofsted.   The early years pupil premium which was introduced in April this year provides nurseries and schools delivering the early education entitlement for three- and four-year-old children with an extra 53p an hour for each eligible child to help them raise the quality of their setting and so close the gap in school readiness between disadvantaged children and their peers. The Government has made £50 million available for the early years pupil premium in 2015-16. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the rationale is for attainment at Key Stage Level 4 being selected as the education indicator in the proposed Life Chance reports.,The end of Key Stage 4 is a vital point in a young persons education.

Successful attainment at Key Stage 4 underpins future life chances. We want all young people to be well prepared for further education higher education and work. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether she plans to introduce mandatory mental health training for education professionals.,"We recognise that education professionals have a vital role to play in raising concerns about eating disorders and other mental health needs as well as providing early support where mental health problems have been identified.

In particular we have supported the development of MindEd a free online portal funded by the Department of Health which enables all adults working with children and young people to learn more about specific mental health problems and how to support them.   To support schools further we have funded the Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) Association to produce guidance and primary and secondary key stages lesson plans on teaching about mental health and emotional wellbeing. These lesson plans cover all the key stages and topics covered at Key Stage 3 and 4.   We have issued advice on mental health and behaviour which clarifies the responsibility of the school points to tools that can be used to help them identify pupils that may be experiencing a mental health problem and outlines what they can do to provide a stable environment that builds good mental health in all pupils. This includes a section on identifying eating disorders and outlines the types of support and treatment that can be offered: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a>.

To drive specific improvements in support for young people with eating disorders the government has made £150 million available over the next 5 years through NHS England. More widely an additional £1.25 billion funding is being made available over the next five years to transform children and young peoples mental health services to deliver more integrated and accessible services.

These lesson plans cover all the key stages and topics covered at Key Stage 3 and 4 including promoting emotional wellbeing healthy coping strategies and eating disorders.     The Government Equalities Office has worked with a range of bodies including the Advertising Association and the National Citizen Service to develop materials that support good practice and encourage young people to become more informed and resilient consumers of media content; and with the PSHE Association to provide guidance for teachers on delivering body image lessons using accredited resources.   To drive specific improvements in support for young people with eating disorders the government has made £150 million available over the next 5 years through NHS England. More widely an additional £1.25 billion funding is being made available over the next five years to transform children and young peoples mental health services to deliver more integrated and accessible services.    <br>   """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans her Department has to increase the skills and qualification level of the early years workforce.,"Early years providers play an important role in developing their workforce in line with Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). The EYFS sets clear staffing and qualification requirements for the workforce. The skills of the workforce have increased significantly with 87% of full day care staff holding level 3 qualification or higher (as of 2013). In order to meet the requirements of the EYFS and to increase the skills and qualification level of the early years workforce the Department for Education has:   <ol>Developed a robust new set of standards for the Early Years Educator qualification at Level 3. Staff operating at Level 3 must also have GCSEs in English and maths at grade C or above. The department has recently made these GCSEs an entry to work requirement rather than an entry to training requirement. This has opened up training routes ensuring more people with the right skills are able to join the early years workforce including individuals on an apprenticeship. Introduced the Early Years Teachers Status for graduates who specialise in early years. Early years teachers must meet the same entry and qualifications requirements as teachers of older children including skills tests and a robust set of teachers standards. </ol> The Early Years Foundation Stage Framework can be found online at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2</a> Guidance on early years educator criteria can be found here: <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-educator-level-3-qualifications-criteria\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-educator-level-3-qualifications-criteria</a> The teachers standards (early years) can be found here: <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards</a> """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans her Department has to ensure that there will be sufficient high quality early education places to meet the proposed target of 30 hours of free childcare a week for working parents of three and four year olds.,The Government is committed to delivering flexible affordable and quality childcare for parents. We are carefully consulting parents employers providers and local authorities and reviewing of the cost of providing childcare with a commitment to increase the average funding rate paid to providers. The market is growing (with around 230000 more places than in 2009) and has already demonstrated that it is able to respond through the roll-out of the entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds introduced in the last Parliament. We recognise that there is natural growth in the childcare system we can and should encourage new providers to enter the childcare market or existing providers to expand. We have supported this expansion with changes made to reduce bureaucracy helping schools to provide places and by enabling the setting up of childminder agencies. Our new entitlement of 30 hours of free childcare provides an opportunity for further growth for existing childcare providers to expand and for new providers to enter the market helping to build a stronger economy and give parents increased choice. Full roll-out is scheduled for September 2017 and our approach will be informed by the experiences of pilot areas in 2016. We want to learn from the experience of early implementers to ensure that the market works effectively for both parents and providers. We are in the process of undertaking a review of the cost of provision and have committed to increasing the average funding rate providers receive which will help the sector to grow. It is important that the hourly rate for the childcare entitlement strikes the right balance between being fair for providers and delivering value for money to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many people have (a) begun and (b) graduated from early years initial teacher training courses in each year since the introduction of the early years teacher status.,The Early Years Foundation Stage sets staffing and qualification requirements for early years providers. The government would like to see more trained graduates in the workforce and we are supporting this by providing funding for course fees and bursaries to eligible trainees and also funding for employers to support trainees.   The number of graduates in the workforce continues to rise and between 2008 and 2013 the proportion of full day care staff with a degree or higher increased from 5% to 13%. The National Day Nursery Associations June 2015 survey showed that 88% of settings employ a graduate Early Years Teacher. There are currently 15962 individuals who have achieved Early Years Professional Status and Early Years Teacher Status.   Since the inception of early years initial teacher training in September 2013 we have recruited an overall number of 3206 trainees of which 2358 have graduated and been awarded Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS). The 2014/15 cohort has 421 individuals still in training and awaiting an outcome. We have set high standards for individuals gaining Early Years Teacher Status as we want individuals of the highest calibre in these roles.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effect of the recent change in entry requirements to NVQ Level 3 Childcare on the recruitment of childcare apprentices.,In July the government announced that trainees wishing to undertake Early Years Educator qualifications either through an apprenticeship or a standalone course would be able to study for their GCSE English and Maths alongside their childcare training rather than being required to hold them on entry to their level 3 course.   By increasing access to both apprenticeships and standalone courses individuals will have greater choice and will be able to take up a course that suits their personal circumstances. The changes have been welcomed by the childcare sector including membership organisations that represent both childcare businesses and individuals who work in childcare. The expected outcome is that a greater number of trainees will be able to access training and subsequently employment in the childcare sector.         
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many childminders have registered with childminder agencies to date.,Childminder agencies (CMAs) are commercial organisations independent of government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she has taken in response to the recommendations of the Independent Review on Poverty and Life Chances published in 2010.,This government wants to see every child fulfilling their potential and succeeding in life.   The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions recently announced that this government will focus on improving life chances by tackling the root causes of child poverty. It believes that action to ensure that parents can work and to improve educational attainment across the board will make the biggest difference to the lives of children now and in the future. The Welfare Reform and Work Bill introduced to Parliament on 9 July includes a new statutory duty for government to report on these two key drivers of childrens life chances.   The government agrees with the view set out in the Independent Review that what happens before children start school is crucial in their development and later attainment. The Effective Pre-school Primary and Secondary Education Project has shown a child has a greater chance of getting better exam results and ultimately earning higher wages by receiving pre-school education. That is why in 2010 the government extended the number of hours of free early education to which all three- and four-year-olds are entitled from 12.5 to 15 hours a week.   Since September 2013 the most disadvantaged two-year-olds across England have been able to access their 15-hour-a-week funded early learning place a year early. The Government has also introduced additional funding to support disadvantaged three and four year olds in early years settings through the Early Years Pupil Premium. This has been designed to close the gap at ages 3 and 4 between the additional support disadvantaged children get at age 2 through the free entitlement and the additional support they get in school through the school-age Pupil Premium. At the Budget the Government reconfirmed its manifesto commitment to help hard-working families reduce the cost of childcare which will make it easier for parents to work if they would like to knowing that their children are well cared for. The Government will set out more information about improving the life chances of children in a Life Chances Strategy in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the disparity in reading ability between different socio-economic groups at age four in each of the last five years.,"The government is committed to improving education to make sure that children from all backgrounds have the skills necessary to succeed in life. The early years curriculum sets out the key areas that early years providers must follow. This includes a focus on literacy communication and language. We have introduced Early Years Teachers who are expected to meet the same entry and qualification requirements as teachers of older children. We have also introduced a robust set of standards for Early Years Educator (EYE) qualifications (A Level standard) and from September 2014 EYEs operating in the workforce at level 3 are required to hold GSCE English and maths at grade C or above.   The information requested is not available. The department does not collect data on the socio economic background of parents of 4-year-olds. However reception teachers must complete the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) in the final term of the year in which the child reaches age five.

They must also complete a short assessment of each childs skills and abilities against three characteristics of effective learning.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will incorporate education on mental health issues into the national curriculum.,"Emotional wellbeing resilience and good mental health are a priority for the Department. As the Secretary of State said in an interview with the Times on 4 July 2015 there are lots of new pressures on young people growing up. We want children to do well academically and attainment is supported if they have good mental health character and resilience. They are two sides of the same coin.   The National Curriculum framework is clear that all schools should teach Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) education Ò a non-statutory national curriculum subject which supports and extends other subjects in the school curriculum such as Citizenship and Information Technology. This helps pupils to develop self-esteem resilience confidence and their ability to learn as well as dealing with specific issues such as online and cyberbullying.   In order to support teachers to improve teaching about mental health in PSHE we have funded the PSHE Association to produce guidance and detailed lesson plans for Key Stages 1-4 which are available online here at: <a href=\https://www.pshe-association.org.uk/news_detail.aspx?ID=1435\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.pshe-association.org.uk/news_detail.aspx?ID=1435</a>   While teachers are well placed to spot where students have a problem they are not mental health professionals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment her Department has made of the reasons for changes in the number of children eligible for free school meals in each of the last three years.,The overall proportion of pupils known to be eligible for and claiming free school meals has reduced nationally over the last three years from 17.1% in 2013 to 16.3% in 2014 to 15.2% in 2015. As the economy improves there are two million more people finding work including parents which is leading to year on year decreases in the numbers of pupils entitled to this benefit. For example the rate of people claiming Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) has been falling steadily for the last three years and this is one the key benefits that provides entitlement to FSM.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to maintain the current provision of children's centre services.,The Department for Education will be launching an open consultation in the autumn about childrens centre services. This will be a consultation that will offer parents carers local authorities and key stakeholders the opportunity to influence and drive what we expect from childrens centre services and where we see them collectively having the greatest impact. This consultation will not just be about the childrens centre buildings but focus on what they provide as part of the integrated services for children and families locally what outcomes they should achieve and what accountability framework is needed to best demonstrate impact.   Local authorities have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure sufficient childrens centres to meet local need and to ensure they consult before any significant changes are made. They are best placed to determine the delivery models and service offering in relation to childrens centres that best meet the needs of their local community.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education which local spending bodies in the city of Birmingham (a) her Department is responsible for and (b) draw on funds voted to her Department.,The Secretary of State has signed funding agreements with 138 academies that fall within the boundaries of Birmingham City Council.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education in what way the eligibility criteria for the pupil premium take account of the level and security of income of parents on (a) zero-hour contracts and (b) temporary contracts.,The main eligibility criterion for the pupil premium is whether a pupil aged 4-16 has been registered for free school meals (FSM) at any point in the last 6 years. FSM eligibility captures both non-working families and families working for less than 16 hours per week and this is based on a parent being in receipt of particular benefits such as: income-based Jobseekers Allowance; income-related Employment and Support Allowance; Child Tax Credit provided they have an annual gross income of no more than £16190 and are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit; and Working Tax Credit run-on paid for four weeks after anyone stops qualifying for Working Tax Credit. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will hold discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on extending the pupil premium to young people aged between 16 and 19 in further education who are (a) looked after children (b) pupils who have left care (c) pupils who have been eligible for the pupil premium at any point in the previous six years and (d) other pupils who were eligible for pupil premium whilst in secondary education; and if she will make a statement.,There are no plans to extend the Pupil Premium to young people aged 16 to 19 who are in further education. All decisions on school and post-16 funding beyond the financial year 2015-16 will be made as part of the forthcoming spending review.   The Government understands the importance of supporting disadvantaged young people over the age of 16 who are in education. As with core funding for schools there are elements within the national funding formula for 16-19 year olds that provide extra funding for disadvantaged students. Post-16 students living in the most deprived areas of the country attracted over £210 million of additional funding within the 16-19 funding formula in the academic year 2015/16.   In addition students who struggled with maths and English at GCSE attracted over £350 million of additional funding within the formula. Schools and colleges decide how they spend this funding to deliver the support most needed by disadvantaged 16-19 year-old students.  Young people aged 16 to19 who are studying in school or college and are also in local authority care or have recently left care are entitled to the 16-19 Student Bursary which is worth up to £1200 yearly.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the potential benefits of a national funding formula for early years education.,The government understands the importance of funding that secures the effective and efficient delivery of early years education. We are aware that there are historical inconsistencies and inefficiencies with the current funding system for the three- and four-year entitlement. The government is committed to early education funding which is simple transparent and maximises funding reaching the front line. Our long term objective is to make funding truly fair. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy to maintain the current National Funding Rate per pupil for full-time students aged 16 to 17 and students aged 18 and over with high needs after 2015-16; and if she will make a statement.,Decisions about the level of funding for 16-18 year olds including the national funding rate in the academic year 2016/17 and beyond will be subject to the outcome of the next spending review which will set the budget for education and other public spending for the coming years. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to support primary school pupils from the poorest families; and if she will make a statement.,We are determined to ensure that every child regardless of background is given an education which allows them to fulfil their potential. As part of a Conservative Party manifesto commitment from the 2010 election we invested an extra £6.25 billion in schools through the pupil premium from 2011-12 to 2014-15 to help raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils including a higher rate of per-pupil funding for primary-aged pupils since April 2014. The latest key stage 2 results are positive: at age 11 disadvantaged pupils attainment in reading writing and mathematics increased by five percentage points to 67% between 2012 and 2014 and the gap with their better-off peers narrowed. Worth £2.5bn this year this Government is committed to providing the pupil premium so schools receive additional money for their most disadvantaged pupils. Decisions on school funding beyond the financial year 2015-16 will be made as part of the forthcoming spending review.

It will inform government decisions about funding for both the existing entitlement and the extension to 30 hours.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will take steps to ensure that early years education is adequately funded on a per capita basis for the lifetime of the Parliament.,"The government recognises that it is important that funding for the early education entitlement is fair and sustainable for providers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much (a) lamb (b) beef (c) pork and (d) poultry meat is purchased annually by schools and colleges for consumption; and what proportion of such meat is British in origin.,Schools and colleges are responsible for their meals services and how and where they choose to buy their produce. The Department for Education does not collect this information.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what research her Department has (a) commissioned and (b) evaluated in the last five years on a link between brain development and nurturing in early years; and what additional resources her Department is providing in (i) Hartlepool (ii) North East England and (iii) England to ensure infants' brains are stimulated and developed.,"The Department for Education recognises the importance of brain development and nurturing in the early years. Research shows that high quality early education in conjunction with effective parenting skills has a positive influence on childrens confidence their capacity to learn and contributes to a sense of well-being and self-worth. The foundations for human development Ò physical intellectual and emotional Ò are laid in early childhood. It is for this reason that the department has invested so heavily in the early education entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds as well as the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. The department has also brought forward a Childcare Bill to give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three- and four-year olds.   The department has commissioned and evaluated a significant amount of research on early education which encompasses consideration of a range of issues such as child development and nurturing. The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework which all registered early years providers must follow recognises that good parenting and high quality early learning together provide the foundation that children need to make the most of their abilities and talents as they grow up. The EYFS is based on evidence considered by Dame Clare Tickell in her 2011 review. A report of the evidence can be found at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-review-report-on-the-evidence\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-review-report-on-the-evidence</a>   A number of other important reviews have also informed this departments policy on early education. These include reports by Graham Allen MP in 2011 on early intervention and Professor Sir Michael Marmot in 2010 which highlighted the important lifelong effects that the early years (starting in the womb) has on many aspects of health and well-being educational achievement and economic status.

A major piece of longitudinal research Study of Early Education and Development (SEED) has been commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of the current early education model in England. SEED will specifically examine the impact on child development of providing funded early years education to two year olds from lower income families. The study will follow the progress of over 5000 children from the age of two up until the end of key stage one at the age of seven. SEED will update evidence from the highly influential Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) that has provided crucial evidence of the benefits of high quality early years education. A full impact report is due in 2020.   Although we do not have a separate funding stream to Ïensure infants brains are stimulated and developed the department continues to invest heavily in the early education entitlement for all three- and four-year-olds and the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. The early years pupil premium (EYPP) was introduced in April 2015 and provides additional support for disadvantaged three- and four-year-olds accessing the government-funded entitlement hours.   For three- and four-year-olds the 2015-16 initial funding allocation for the existing entitlement and the early years pupil premium is: <table><tbody> 3/4-year-old entitlementEYPP Total Hartlepool£2.99 million £135000£3.13 millionNorth East England£92.89 million £2.98 million£95.87 millionEngland£2.18 billion £50 million£2.23 billion</tbody></table>                   These data are published and are available at: <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2015-to-2016\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2015-to-2016</a>   Funding allocations for 2015-16 for two-year-olds will be announced in July 2015 as this is the first year of participation-based funding for two-year-olds. The hourly rate for two-year-olds was announced in October 2015 for all local authorities. Children in Hartlepool will receive £4.85 per hour and the national average hourly funding rate is £5.09.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what her policy in on providing support for childcare costs incurred from providers not registered with Ofsted.,The Department for Education provides support with the costs of childcare through the early education entitlement for two- three- and four-year-olds delivered by Ofsted registered providers. This support is worth around £3 billion a year.   The government only funds registered providers so that minimum safeguards and standards which are set out in regulations are assured and children kept secure and safe from harm. Providers who deliver the early education entitlement are registered with Ofsted on the Early Years Register and are subject to a rigorous registration process. They are also subject to inspection that covers quality assessment as well as compliance with basic standards. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the VAT costs incurred by sixth form colleges in each of the last five years; and if she will make a statement.,The Department for Education estimates that VAT accounts for about 3% of sixth form colleges expenditure each year.  The Education Funding Agency does not collect financial information from sixth form colleges in such a way that allows us to make a more precise year on year calculation of their VAT costs.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking in schools to tackle childhood obesity.,This government has made a manifesto commitment to tackle childhood obesity. Many of the Department for Educations polices make a direct contribution to tackling obesity in school age children. The School Food Plan was published in 2013 to encourage and promote a positive healthy food culture in schools. New food standards were introduced earlier this year and universal infant free school meals have been implemented so that we now have an average of 85% of children in reception Year 1 and Year 2 eating a healthy and nutritious lunch. Pupils in primary and secondary schools are taught about the importance of leading healthy and active lives including diet nutrition and exercise through the new national curriculum. Food and nutrition education is now compulsory from Key Stage 1 to 3 Ò this is the first time it has been compulsory in secondary schools. Over £300 million of ring-fenced funding has been allocated to primary schools through the primary PE and sport premium since 2013 to help pupils develop healthy lifestyles.  In addition the department is actively engaged in work across government to develop a national obesity framework by the end of this year.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 4 June 2015 to Question 333 what guidance her Department issues to local authorities on the employment of educational psychologists.,The Department for Education does not issue guidance to local authorities on the employment of educational psychologists. Educational psychologists have a duty to provide psychological advice into the new Education Health and Care (EHC) plans and review process (Children and Families Act 2014). 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education for what reason the Government decided not to provide VAT rebates for sixth form colleges along with VAT rebates for sixth forms in state schools as well as academies and other free school variants.,Sixth form colleges (SFCs) do not qualify for VAT refunds as they are not part of local government nor are they academies. The VAT treatment of SFCs is determined by their classification which is designated by the Office for National Statistics. Colleges including SFCs have been liable for VAT since they ceased to be part of the local government sector in 1993. In order for SFCs to be classified differently significant changes to their governance accountability and administration (i.e. in the direction of greater central government control) would be required which may not be a route that SFCs wish to take. At the end of any such restructuring the ONS would review how to reclassify the SFC. There is the possibility that even after such changes the ONS would not necessarily change their classification to one where it was possible for them to reclaim VAT.Decisions regarding future 16 to 19 funding will be subject to the outcome of the next spending round where this decision may be revisited.

We have confirmed that our departments will continue to work closely together on reforms to children and young peoples mental health services following the publication in March of ÷Future in Mind the report of the work of the DH and NHS England task force on children and young peoples mental health and well-being. Joined up action across health education and childrens services will help to make sure that understanding of mental health is on an equal footing with physical health that mental health issues are not stigmatising for children and young people and that services are accessible where support is needed and responsive to the needs of individuals.   The Department for Education is already committing £1.5m to the development of a joint training pilot with NHS England to train mental health leads in schools and specialist child and adolescent mental health services. In addition the department is providing funding worth £4.7m this year to support 17 projects delivering a wide range of support across the country to children and young people with mental health issues. The department has also funded PSHE Association guidance on teaching about mental health in PSHE which was published in March 2015. This will be followed by a set of lesson plans spanning key stages 1-4 which will be available for schools before the end of the summer term.

We have set this expectation through revised statutory guidance which underpins schools duty to secure independent careers guidance. In addition a new employer-led Careers and Enterprise Company will encourage greater collaboration between schools and colleges and employers helping young people to access the best advice and inspiration.  The National Careers Service provides over 1 million people annually with impartial and professional careers information advice and guidance to help them enter work learning or progress in life. Last year the National Careers Service went through a complete reconfiguration with all its contracts procured through a comprehensive open and competitive tendering process. The new contracts awarded in October 2014 are on a payment by results basis. 94% of face-to-face and telephone customers agreed that the overall quality of the service was good.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education with reference to HM Treasury's press release Chancellor announces £4.5 billion of measures to bring down debt published on 4 June 2015 what efficiency savings she plans to make to education for 16 to 19 year olds; and how such savings will be applied.,The savings announced by the Chancellor will come from a variety of measures including expected departmental underspends in demand-led budgets efficiencies and some small budgetary reductions.   The allocations for the education of 16- to 19-year-olds in the 2015/16 academic year that were announced in March remain in place and we are not planning to change them. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to her Answer of 15 June to Question 1850 what the budgetary reductions are; and how they were decided.,We expect the majority of the savings to come from departmental underspends in demand-led budgets.   No savings will be made from protected schools funding and we have no plans to change the allocations for the education of 16 to 19-year-olds in the 2015/16 academic year that were announced in March 2015. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 15 June 2015 to Question 900313 if she will ensure that sixth form colleges are treated on the same basis as schools academies free schools and university technical colleges for the recovery of VAT.,Funding decisions will be considered in the round at the Spending Review.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education by what process the Government plans to run a consultation with the childcare sector on the provision of 30 hours a week free childcare.,"We recognise it is essential that we talk to parents and providers about the new entitlement. We have already launched a call for evidence to inform our review of the cost of providing childcare (<a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/cost-of-providing-childcare-review-call-for-evidence\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/cost-of-providing-childcare-review-call-for-evidence</a>).

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether it is her policy that families with parents in full-time further education will be eligible for 30 hours a week free childcare under the Government's new childcare proposals.,"The additional hours will be available to families where both parents are working or the sole parent is working in a lone parent family. Further information on the detail of which parents will qualify will be announced in due course.   Parents who are in full time education are already able to access help with the costs of childcare. Full-time higher education students with children can apply for a Childcare Grant of: <ul>up to £150.23 a week for 1 child;up to £257.55 a week for 2 or more children.</ul>   The grant helps with childcare costs for children under-15 or under-17 if they have special educational needs.   Parents must be eligible for student finance to apply for a Childcare Grant.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the potential cost of the introduction of 30 hours a week free childcare.,As I announced on Monday 15 June 2015 the department will be conducting a review of the cost of providing childcare. This will inform the cost of the new childcare entitlement of 30 hours for working families which will be considered as part of the Budget and Spending Review process. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether her Department plans to include provisions in the Childcare Bill for extra funding for children currently in receipt of disability living allowance for children or enhanced child tax credits as a consequence of a disability.,"The government is absolutely committed to supporting families with disabled children. We want every eligible parent that wants to take advantage of the new entitlement to be able to. That includes parents of children with disabilities and therefore we will of course consider issues of funding and accessibility for those children.   The first part of this is our cross-government review of the cost of providing childcare which will include a consideration of the costs for children with additional needs. A call for evidence to inform the review was launched on 15 June and will close on 10 August 2015.  The call for evidence is available here: <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/cost-of-providing-childcare-review-call-for-evidence\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/consultations/cost-of-providing-childcare-review-call-for-evidence</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what eligibility provisions she plans to propose for children of families in which parents live apart or with different legal partners to be entitled to 30 hours a week free childcare under the Government's childcare proposals.,The additional hours will be available to families where both parents are working or the sole parent is working in a lone parent family. More detail will be available in due course. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much her Department has spent on mental health services for school students in (a) York Central constituency and (b) England in each of the last five years.,"The Department for Education does not specially allocate funding to mental health services. Local Authorities may choose to use some of the funding allocated to them in this way but that is not the subject of data collection.   It is a priority for us to support schools and other settings in how best to help pupils succeed through the development of character resilience and good mental health. We are providing nearly £5m in funding this year to a number of voluntary and community sector projects supporting the mental health needs of children and young people as well as supporting Childline which provides a free 24-hour UK wide counselling service supporting young people with issues causing distress or concern including suicidal feelings.   We also funded the Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) Association to produce guidance to improve teaching about mental health in PSHE in March 2015.

"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the need for changing the formula by which spending is determined in English schools.,School funding is based on historic data which often means that it does not reflect current pupils needs. It is unfair that a school in one part of the country can attract over 50% more funding than an identical school elsewhere in the country. In 2015-16 an additional £390 million was given to local authorities considered to have been unfairly funded for schools in previous years. This was a significant step towards fairer funding; we are committed to making further progress. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to ensure equal access to all-age careers guidance services across the UK.,"Policy for education including careers guidance is devolved within the UK. The response below relates only to policy in England. The governments policy on careers guidance aims to ensure that people of all ages can access high quality support when they need it. Schools and colleges in England have a legal responsibility to secure independent careers guidance for all 12- to- 18-year-olds. This must include information on the full range of education or training options including apprenticeships. The National Careers Service was launched in April 2012 and provides professional and impartial careers information advice and guidance to adults and young people aged 13 and over to support their decision making about learning and work. Support is available to adults and young people via a website web chat or National Contact Centre helpline. The service also offers face to face help for adults over 19 (18 if in receipt of out of work benefits). The National Careers Service users satisfaction and progression survey shows that 94% of face-to-face and telephone customers agreed that the overall quality of the service was good. The survey report is available at <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-careers-service-satisfaction-and-progression-surveys-2013-to-2014-report\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-careers-service-satisfaction-and-progression-surveys-2013-to-2014-report</a> From October 2014 we enhanced the role of the National Careers Service. National Careers Service contractors now have a responsibility to work with schools and colleges to facilitate relationships with local employers. They will work closely with the new Careers and Enterprise Company whose core purpose is to take a lead role in transforming the provision of careers enterprise and employer engagement experiences for young people to inspire them to take control of and shape their own futures.    """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans she has for improving the provision of and access to careers guidance.,"We want to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to reach their potential and leave education with the skills to succeed in modern Britain. This includes improving the extent and quality of careers guidance by encouraging greater collaboration between schools and colleges and employers.

A new Careers and Enterprise Company is on track to increase the level of employer input into schools and colleges helping young people to access the best advice and inspiration. It will manage a network of enterprise advisers who will assist schools and colleges in choosing effective careers and enterprise organisations to partner with and welcome by stakeholders. This will result in more stimulating and improved activity in areas where current provision is poorest.We have established a clear accountability system. Revised guidance clarifies our expectations of schools and colleges in relation to their duty to secure independent careers guidance and will take effect from September 2015. Ofsted is giving a higher priority to careers guidance in school inspections. We publish destination measures which help schools and colleges to be held to account locally and inform choices by parents and students."""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether she plans to review secondary school funding formulae in (a) Peterborough and (b) England; and if she will make a statement.,The previous government took the first step in reforming school funding by allocating an additional £390 million in 2015-16 to the local authorities that it considered to have been unfairly funded in previous years. 69 local authorities benefitted from this additional funding including Peterborough which received an additional £860000. As we pledged in our manifesto we will build on these reforms and make schools funding fairer across the country for both primary and secondary schools. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the terms of reference and timescale are of the Government's planned review into the funding rate of free childcare for three and four year olds.,"The Government has committed to increasing the average rate that providers are paid for the entitlement and in order to deliver this I can confirm that a cross-Government review of the cost of providing childcare is underway.   The objective of the review is to inform decisions on the level of funding providers require to deliver quality childcare provision at good value to the taxpayer and to be consistent with the governments fiscal plans.   A call for evidence to inform the review was launched on 15 June and will close on 10 August. This is part of a process of gathering the necessary evidence which will inform the outcome of the review and will report in the autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of how many local authority areas do not have the capacity to expand the provision of childcare from 15 hours to 30 hours; and what steps the Government plans to take in those areas to provide such capacity.,The childcare market is growing and there are around 230000 more childcare places than in 2009. We have supported this expansion with changes made to reduce bureaucracy helping schools to provide places and by enabling the setting up of childminder agencies. This new entitlement provides an opportunity for further growth for existing childcare providers to expand and for new providers to enter the market helping to build a stronger economy and give parents increased choice.   We have a sensible delivery timetable that gives the market time to expand and adapt as we know will be necessary. Full roll-out of the entitlement is scheduled for September 2017 and our approach will be informed by the experiences of pilot areas in 2016.   We are working with the sector to better understand the scale of the challenge and intend to consult with parents and providers in due course. We are in the process of undertaking a review of the cost of provision and have committed to increasing the average funding rate providers receive which will help the sector to grow.<br>  
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if the Government will take steps to maintain the schools budget and per-pupil spending in Hertfordshire.,At a time of difficult financial decisions for the country we have made a conscious choice to prioritise spending on education. We will continue to protect the schools budget and will ensure that the funding schools receive increases as pupil numbers increase. In 2015-16 we added £390million to the budgets of 69 local authorities considered to have been unfairly funded in previous years including £11.3million of additional funding for Hertfordshire. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether she plans reductions in spending on education and training for 16 to 19 year olds in order to implement the decision announced on 4 June 2015 to reduce the funding of her Department.,The savings announced by the Chancellor will come from a variety of measures including expected departmental underspends in demand-led budgets efficiencies and some small budgetary reductions. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what information her Department holds on strategies adopted by secondary schools to educate young people in coping with poor mental health and suicidal thoughts.,"We recognise that schools have a vital role to play in helping to promote good mental health for all their pupils as well as providing early support where mental health problems have been identified. It is important that schools can develop approaches to supporting pupils which suit their particular circumstances. While we do not collect information on the approaches taken the department has produced a number of pieces of guidance which reflect practice in schools.   We are providing nearly £5m in funding this year to a number of voluntary and community sector projects supporting the mental health needs of children and young people as well as supporting Childline which provides a free 24-hour UK wide counselling service supporting young people with issues causing distress or concern including suicidal feelings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans she has to reduce the budget for the education and training of 16 to 19-year olds to meet the £450 million savings to be found in her Department in this financial year.,The savings announced by the Chancellor will come from a variety of measures including expected departmental underspends in demand-led budgets efficiencies and some small budgetary reductions.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to promote good mental health among (a) deaf children and young people in mainstream education and (b) such children and young people in other contexts.,"The Government is committed to improving the mental health and wellbeing of all children and young people. Mainstream and special schools have a vital role to play in helping to promote good mental health for all their pupils as well as providing early support where mental health problems have been identified. To support them to do this we have funded the PSHE Association to publish age-appropriate guidance to improve teaching about mental health within PSHE. This will be followed by a set of lesson plans spanning key stages 1-4 which will be available for schools to use by September 2015.

For children the impact of deafness on their social &amp; psychological development as well as their communication literacy and educational achievement can be dramatic. Good mental health is one of the four positive outcomes for all children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) that are at the heart of the recent SEND reforms. These reforms created a holistic and responsive approach to meeting the education health and care needs of disabled children and young people including those with hearing impairments. For those with more complex needs including pupils in special schools statements are being replaced by Education Health and Care Plans. These are intended to cover the full range of the child or young persons needs including consideration of their mental health and wellbeing. This is to recognise the interaction between the issues they face and the need for joined up support. Children and young people should be involved in developing their EHC plan to ensure that their ambitions and the things that are important to them are reflected. The statutory guidance is available here: <a href=\""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25</a> Where mental health needs are identified it is important that suitable effective provision can be made.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment she has made of whether the budget allocations to (a) local authority maintained schools and (b) schools receiving funding from the Education Funding Agency for 2015-16 and are projected to receive in 2016 and 2017 will be sufficient to fund (i) increases to employer's contributions to teachers' and support staff's pensions (ii) increases in teachers' and support staff's salaries and (iii) other costs.,The Government is committed to protecting the schools budget and will ensure that the funding schools receive increases as pupil numbers increase. On current pupil number forecasts there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in this parliament. We will look carefully at the impact of changes in schools costs when making plans for education spending in 2016-17 and onwards and will continue to provide information and guidance to help schools improve their efficiency and manage their finances. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she is taking to ensure there is an adequate number of school places; and if she will make a statement.,Supporting local authorities to create school places where they are needed most is one of the Departments top priorities. The Coalition Government invested over £5 billion in providing new school places between 2011 and 2015 and this Government has committed to a further £7 billion in capital funding between 2015 and 2021. Local authorities have risen to the challenge delivering 445000 new places since 2010 with many more in the pipeline. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will allocate additional funding to local authorities which have a shortfall of nursery and school places to expand existing schools.,Supporting local authorities to create places where they are needed most is one of the Departments top priorities. We have committed £7billion in capital funding between 2015 and 2021 to help local authorities create places in reception to year 11. We have invited free schools to apply for capital funding for nursery provision and local authorities have the freedom to spend some of their capital funding on nursery places if this is a local priority. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether the Government plans to reduce funding for education and training for 16 to 19 year olds.,Decisions about how 16-19 institutions will be funded in the academic year 2016/17 and beyond will be subject to the outcome of the next spending review which will set the budget for education and other public spending for the coming years. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much her Department provides to Lincolnshire County Council to fund an hour's care for each child in pre-school nursery care.,"The Department for Education funds local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant for delivering the early years entitlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make it her policy to maintain the number of sure start centres in England.,It is up to local authorities to decide how to organise and commission services from childrens centres in their areas. They are best placed to understand local needs and the different ways they can be supported locally. Local authorities must demonstrate that they have devised ways to ensure that services continue; what matters is the quality and impact of services and how local needs are being supported. We are clear in statutory guidance that there is a presumption against closure and local authorities have a duty to consult where changes are planned to local childrens centre provision. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of using free school meal eligibility for the purposes of allocating Pupil Premium funding.,"In July 2010 the previous Government launched a consultation on introducing a pupil premium. This identified potential indicators for distributing the pupil premium towards economically disadvantaged pupils. These included: current and historic Free School Meal (FSM) eligibility an indicator based on a pupils family being in receipt of out of work tax credits; and area-based measures of deprivation such as Mosaic or Acorn.  In response to the consultation it was concluded that the best available indicator used to reflect socio-economic disadvantage from 2011-12 onwards would be FSM eligibility because this is the only current pupil-level indicator; it is familiar to parents schools and local authorities; it is easily collected and updated annually; and schools will know precisely which of their pupils are eligible. Furthermore there is strong evidence that pupils who are currently or have recently been eligible for FSM have lower educational outcomes than their peers. In 2011-12 the pupil premium was allocated to schools on the basis of pupils currently FSM eligible; and from April 2012 onwards on the basis of pupils who have been FSM eligible at any point in the last six years. The consultation response is available here: <a href=\http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/t/the%20school%20funding%20settlement%20for%202011%2012%20the%20pupil%20premium%20and%20dedicated%20schools%20grant.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/t/the%20school%20funding%20settlement%20for%202011%2012%20the%20pupil%20premium%20and%20dedicated%20schools%20grant.pdf</a>"""
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what plans she has to make additional mental health provision available through the education system to those aged under 18.,"Schools and colleges have an important role to play in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of their students.

They will also be publishing a set of lesson plans spanning key stage 1 to key stage 4 which will be available for schools to use by September 2015.  We expect that schools will want to use these and other resources to develop the support that they provide. We will continue to work with the sector to look at what further information and support might be helpful.   We know that many schools already provide their pupils with support such as counselling and play an important role in enabling access to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Teachers however are not mental health professionals and it is important that students can get swift access to specialist mental health support where needed. The recent ÷Future in Mind report set out our ambitions for improving care over the next five years including on making better links between schools and specialist services.

This qualification will be a valuable stepping stone for young people wishing to develop their skills interests and career paths in food-related professions.   Our reforms to careers guidance in England are based on schools connecting pupils with employers helping them to understand the breadth of career opportunities available. The new independent Careers and Enterprise Company announced by the Secretary of State for Education in December 2014 will help secondary schools to build these links. We also welcome the work of programmes such as Primary Futures which help to broaden the aspirations of young people from an even earlier age.  Schools should consciously work to prevent all forms of stereotyping in the advice and guidance they provide in order to ensure that boys and girls from all backgrounds consider the widest possible range of careers. This is made clear in statutory guidance for schools which underpins their careers duty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what specialist support is provided within schools for pupils with mental health problems.,"Schools have an important role to play in supporting children and young people around good mental health. Many schools provide their pupils with support services such as counselling. In order to help them do this effectively the Department for Education published a blueprint for school counselling services on 25 March 2015. This was developed in conjunction with experts in the field and provides head teachers with practical advice on how to secure high-quality school based counselling services. More information can be found at: <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counselling-in-schools</a>.

However the Department recognises that teachers are not mental health professionals and need access to specialist support. Our ÷Mental health and behaviour in schools guidance first published in June 2014 provides teachers with information and tools that will help them to identify pupils who need help provide effective early support and understand when a referral to a specialist mental health service may be necessary.

In order to inform future practice the Department will be contributing £1.5 million in 2015-16 to a joint pilot with NHS England to test joint training for single points of contact in specialist services and schools.  On 14 March the Government announced an additional £1.25 billion in funding over five years from April 2015 to secure better access to specialist services for children and young people with mental health problems. This will mean that at least 100000 more children and young people will receive treatment by 2020 and this funding will pay for the introduction of new waiting time standards. <a title=\""\"" href=\""http://3dcpri-papp09/new_parliamentaryquestion/228880-%20Mike%20Kane/Draft/228880%20-%20QA%20-%20250315.docx#_ftnref1\"" target=\""_blank\"">[1]</a> <a href=\""http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-mental-health-services-for-young-people\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-mental-health-services-for-young-people</a> """
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps she has taken in (a) primary and (b) secondary schools to reduce the incidence of suicide.,"Where schools have immediate concerns about the risk of suicide their safeguarding role is set out in our statutory guidance Keeping Children Safe in Education. This emphasises that schools should have a designated senior lead with responsibility for the handling of safeguarding concerns in place. Where schools have immediate concerns about the risk of suicide an immediate referral should be made to childrens social care.   Schools can also play an important role in identifying mental health issues early and ensuring that pupils get support to prevent problems from escalating. One in ten children has a diagnosable mental health disorder and the Government is committed to improving support for these young people. The Department for Education is taking action to tackle the stigma around mental health promote positive wellbeing and to ensure pupils have the support and knowledge that they need to keep themselves healthy and safe.   In order to support schools the Department is publishing new guidance for both primary and secondary schools. This guidance is produced in conjunction with the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHE). This will help them to provide age-appropriate teaching on a range of mental health problems including anxiety depression and self-harm.

Many schools already provide pupils with access to counselling services providing children and young people with safe environments where they can discuss problems and receive support. The Department is publishing new guidance for primary and secondary schools on how to deliver good quality school-based counselling services to support their pupils.   The Department knows that children and young people who are persistently bullied are more likely to suffer from poor mental health and emotional wellbeing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many planning areas in England are in need of additional primary school places by September 2015; in how many of those planning areas there has never been an application to open a primary or all-through mainstream free school; and how many of these planning areas have no open primary or all-through mainstream free schools.,The Department collects information from local authorities on the number of school places in state-funded primary and secondary schools as part of the annual School Capacity Collection. Out of a total of 2444 primary planning areas across England there were 584 primary planning areas where the local authority forecast for 2015/16 (from May 2014) was greater than the capacity as reported at May 2014. This comparison of forecasts and capacities does not take into account the number of additional places that have been or will be created after May 2014 through targeted basic need projects new free schools and places being provided through local authority projects.   In the early stages of the free school policy proposer groups were not obliged to provide a specific site for their proposed school so we are unable to ascertain the number of planning areas in need of additional primary school places in 2015 where there has never been a primary or all-through free school application.     As at May 2014 573 of the 584 planning areas in need of additional school places by September 2015 did not have an open primary free school or all-through primary free school. Ten of these planning areas had a primary-phase free school open in September 2014.   Every free school has been opened in response to either the need to provide extra school places the need to provide parents with greater choice or the need to provide more high quality school places. Almost three quarters of free schools have opened in areas with a forecast need for more places and 94 per cent of free schools approved since January 2014 plan to open in areas with a need for more school places.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent steps she has taken to help parents in work with the costs of childcare.,The Department for Education understands that the cost of childcare can be a concern for many parents. In order to help support parents the Department has increased funding in the early years from £2 billion to £3 billion a year over the course of this Parliament.   The Department has provided funding for 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds. The funding for all three- and four-year-olds is worth £2500 per child per year to parents. This gives an additional £425 per child per year when compared to funding prior to the last election. The funding for approximately 40% of two-year-olds is also worth £2500 per child per year.   In addition the Department is introducing Tax-Free Childcare under which up to 1.8 million working families could benefit from up to £2000 per child per year.   For working parents on lower incomes working tax credit pays up to 70% of their childcare costs. This could be worth up to £6370 for their first child. Under Universal Credit the subsidy rate will increase to 85% of childcare costs and support will be available for the first time to those working fewer than 16 hours per week.   Furthermore the Department has taken action to give more choice to parents by creating child minder agencies and supporting schools to open nurseries and offer provision from 8am to 6pm. The Department is also introducing shared parental leave.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what compulsory training is provided to auxiliary staff in schools to assist them in dealing with students suffering severe mental anxiety.,"There is no compulsory training for school staff. Head teachers are best placed to make decisions about what professional development is required by school staff in order to meet the needs of their pupils. A report in 2014 by the independent Think Tank CentreForum found that out of 750 schools surveyed 91% had access to training and professional development opportunities on mental health issues.   In June 2014 in order to help school staff identify and support children and young people with mental health issues the Department for Education issued advice for schools and staff on pupils mental health and behaviour: <a href=\http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2</a>. This provides information guidance and practical tools on how to build resilience and support good mental health. This guidance highlights that schools can use MindEd <a href=\""http://www.minded.org.uk/\"" target=\""_blank\"">www.minded.org.uk</a> an online resource funded by the Department of Health that provides information and training on mental health issues for all adults who work with children and young people.   However most school staff are not mental health professionals and need to have timely access to appropriate specialist support when necessary. We have been working with the Department of Health and NHS Englands Young Peoples Mental Health and Wellbeing Taskforce on how to improve child and adolescent mental health services and develop the way services work with schools. The taskforce is due to report later this month.   Many schools provide pupils with access to counselling services. With the support of experts across the sector the Department for Education is developing advice on what makes for good quality counselling services in primary and secondary schools. This will be published in March 2015. """
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to the Answer of 9 February 2015 to Question 223247 what funding the Government has allocated to the Student Forum in each of the last five years.,The Student Forum was established by the Government to help share best practice between local councils Electoral Registration Officers and universities. It does not require funding itself; instead the Government has funded national organisations and Electoral Registration Officers to carry out activities to increase the completeness and accuracy of the electoral register. This funding amounts to £14 million over the past two financial years and includes a specific allocation of £530000 for student organisations. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to the Answer of 9 February 2015 to Question 223245 what information his Department holds on the uses to which funds released to individual Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) under section 31 of the Local Government Act in 2014-15 have been put by EROs.,In 2014/15 Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) have received £27 million resource funding to support them in the transition to Individual Electoral Registration. EROs have also received a share of £6.8 million funding to support activities such as targeted canvassing mail-outs and communications campaigns aimed at increasing the completeness and accuracy of the electoral register with allocations based on levels of under registration. This funding is paid to EROs via grants under Section 31 of the Local Government Act (2003).   Where EROs can justify the need for further support bids for additional funding can be made. These are assessed on a case by case basis.
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to the Answer of 9 February 2015 to Question 223244 if he will increase the budget available to Electoral Registration Officers who bid for additional support.,In 2014/15 Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) have received £27 million resource funding to support them in the transition to Individual Electoral Registration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much and by what percentage the cost of childcare has increased (a) in nurseries and (b) for childminders in London since 2010.,"<table><tbody>The Department for Education does not collect its own data but uses cost information from a number of independent surveys such as the Family and Childcare Trust Annual Childcare Cost Survey 2015 which can be found online at: <a href=\http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-costs-surveys\"" target=\""_blank\"">http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-costs-surveys</a>. The FCT survey measures the average market price for 25 hours of paid-for childcare and therefore takes no account of the 15 hours free early education and childcare that the majority of parents of young children are entitled to.</tbody></table>   The Department has already increased funding in the early years from £2 billion to £3 billion a year over the course of this Parliament. We are the first Government to fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds. The funding for all three and four-year-olds is worth an additional £425 a year per child; and the funding for around 40% of two-year-olds £2500 a year per child.   We will be introducing Tax-Free Childcare from autumn 2015 under which up to 1.8 million working families could benefit by up to £2000 per child per year. For working parents on low and middle incomes working tax credit pays up to 70% of their childcare costs which could be worth up to £6370 for their first child. Under Universal Credit the subsidy rate will increase to 85% of childcare costs and support will be available for the first time to those working fewer than 16 hours per week.   In relation to childcare costs in London being higher we have invested £30 million to increase the number of childcare places available for two-year-olds and to encourage more school nurseries to open from 8am - 6pm. Linked with this we are working with the Family and Childcare Trust the Greater London Authority and the Local Government Association and with the support of London Councils on a project to help schools in London develop flexible full-day nursery provision. The project and the learning it generates will increase the amount of flexible childcare available and the choices that parents have.     """

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will collect information on the number of people with a learning disability who (a) register to vote under the new individual electoral registration system and (b) vote in the 2015 General Election.,It is not possible to monitor the number of people with a learning disability who (a) register to vote and (b) vote in the forthcoming election as no record is made of disability when registering to vote or when voting.The Cabinet Office is funding Mencap to increase the representation of people with learning disabilities on the electoral register.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment his Department has made of the accuracy of the data provided by the Electoral Commission on the 2014 Electoral Registers used for the implementation of Individual Electoral Registration.,The Government has not produced its own analysis.The registers used for the implementation of Individual Electoral Registration in 2014 were those published before the transition. The Electoral Commission has published its own analysis of the completeness and accuracy of the electoral registers published in February in England and March 2014 in Scotland.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make an assessment of the potential implications for her policy on early years interventions of the study by Professor James Heckman on the economics of human potential.,Providing children with good-quality education and care in their earliest years can help them succeed at school and later in life. This contributes to creating a society where opportunities are equal regardless of background. We believe we can improve early education by building a stronger and better-qualified early years workforce. We also aim to provide more good-quality affordable childcare.   Professor James Heckman has published a number of (mostly US based) studies which form part of a much wider evidence base on the substantial benefits of investing in early education. Professor Heckman reports that early education has significant positive impacts on a childs development and attainment and finds that these impacts can be larger for disadvantaged children. Taken as a whole the evidence underpins the Departments policy to provide an entitlement to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year for all 3 and 4-year-olds and disadvantaged 2-year-olds.   The Department for Education has no current plans to make an assessment of the potential implications for policy on early years interventions of Professor Heckmans most recent work.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps the Government is taking to increase voter registration in Coventry following the switch to individual electoral registration.,The Government is investing over £14 million between financial years 2013/14 and 2014/15 to support the costs of activities aimed at increasing the completeness and accuracy of the register.Over £10.5 million of this funding is being shared across every Electoral Registration Officer in Great Britain with Coventry City Council receiving a total of £70000. Coventry City Council has also been allocated over £140000 resource funding to support the transition to Individual Electoral Registration.In addition on-line registration makes registering to vote more accessible than ever before. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what funding the Government has provided to increase student voter registration following the switch to individual electoral registration.,The Cabinet Office has been running a student forum since early 2013 which brings together organisations that represent universities and students to agree and evaluate best practice to register students.In addition the Government has recently announced £9.8 million to be used to maximise registration rates. Part of this allocation will go to organisations that can support activities to register currently under registered groups including students. £6.8 million will go to Electoral Registration Officers to support their activities to register their key groups such as students. This is in addition to the previous allocation of £4.2 million which has in part been spent on increasing the rate of student registrations. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many people have been informed that their application for inclusion on the voting register was not valid because their national insurance number was not provided since the introduction of individual electoral registration.,Failure to provide a National Insurance number does not result in an application being declared invalid.Electoral Registration Officers have alternative methods of verifying an application including requesting documentary evidence of identity if personal identifiers such as the National Insurance number or date of birth are absent.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what estimate she has made of the number of new childcare places that will be created through the Childcare Business Grant scheme in 2015-16.,The ÷Childcare Business Grant Scheme has been running since 2013 and has so far distributed £1.4 million to new childcare businesses supporting around 5000 new child minders. In the Autumn statement it was announced that the scheme will be extended with an additional £2 million made available to new childcare businesses during 2015/16 to help parents access the childcare they need.   The ÷Childcare Business Grant Scheme is the responsibility of the Government Equalities Office and they have yet to finalise details of the extension to the scheme. The Department for Education has not yet made any such assessment or estimate of the number of childcare places that will be created. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to the Answer of 6 January 2015 to Question 219123 what proportion of people who initiated an online registration failed to finish that registration; and what information he holds on the main reason for failure to conclude the registration process.,"Performance data relating to the online registration system is available at <a href=\https://www.gov.uk/performance/register-to-vote\"" target=\""_blank\"">https://www.gov.uk/performance/register-to-vote</a>.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps his Department is taking to increase levels of individual electoral registration among (a) attainers and (b) students.,The Government announced on 9 January £9.8 million to help increase the accuracy of the electoral register. As part of this every Electoral Registration Officer in Great Britain will share £6.8 million to support their activities to increase voter registration including students and attainers.Remaining funding will go to organisations that can support activities to register currently under registered groups including students. This builds on the Governments previous investment of £4.2 million for maximising registration in 2013/14. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether there are circumstances in which where parents have twins each child is entitled to less than the standard allocation of 15 hours of free childcare per week for 38 weeks of the year.,All three- and four-year-olds and any two-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria are entitled to a Government funded early education place of 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year. There are no circumstances when parents with twins who are both eligible for a funded place would be entitled to receive fewer hours of funded early education.
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Electoral Commission has endorsed the inclusion of 17 year old attainers on the electoral register; and what assessment he has made of the effect of this inclusion on the number of 18 year olds registered to vote.,The Representation of the People Act 1983 provides for attainers to be included in the electoral register. The Electoral Commission has not been asked to endorse this. The government has made no assessment of the effect this inclusion has on the number of 18 year olds registered to vote. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many nursery school places have been created in (a) Bradford East constituency and (b) Bradford since 2008.,"The Department for Education does not collect or hold information about the number of places which have been created or are available in nursery schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the Answer of 25 November 2014 to Question 906346 what live data health services and local authorities are permitted to share with children's centres.,The Department for Educations Sure Start Childrens Centres statutory guidance states that health services and local authorities should share information such as live birth data and data on families with children under five who have recently moved into the area with childrens centres on a regular basis.  Individual data items that this would include are subject to local partnership agreements or protocols developed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many and which children's centres there were in the 10 per cent most deprived wards in England in (a) 2010 and (b) 2014.,The Department for Education does not hold the information in the form requested and to produce the analysis would incur disproportionate cost.The Evaluation of Childrens Centres in England (ECCE) published in June 2014 shows that of those centres evaluated in 2013 17 per cent were situated in the 10 per cent most disadvantaged neighbourhoods nationally. This is only based on a small sample (128 centres) and is unlikely to be generally representative. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department has taken to support parents in bolstering the cognitive development of their children before they reach primary school.,Research shows that parental involvement in early learning as part of daily family life has a critical impact on childrens well-being and achievement.The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework requires a childs key worker to seek to engage and support parents and/or carers in guiding their childs development at home. They should also help families engage with more specialist support if appropriate. Ofsted inspect registered providers against these requirements. The Department recognises early education improves the life chances of children and that is why we have extended free childcare to around 40% of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. This means more parents than ever are benefitting from being in regular contact with an early years practitioner and understand what to expect and how to support their childs physical emotional and cognitive development. The Department encourages early years providers including children centres to use their outreach services in promoting the importance of a positive early home learning environment to parents. I am also working closely with Ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health to ensure that closer working between early years practitioners and Health Visitors means that parents can benefit from both sets of professional expertise in getting a rounded picture of their childs development at age two. This new policy of integrated reviews supports early intervention which we know can improve outcomes. Working with Public Health England I plan to provide more information to parents to help them understand the developmental milestones and expectations for young children and help them to feel more confident in how they can support that development as parents.
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the effect of proposed changes to identity checks on applicants to register as voters on people with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment; whether he has sought legal advice on the compatibility of those proposed changes with (a) the Equality Act 2010 and (b) the Human Rights Act 1998; and if he will make a statement.,In accordance with the Representation of the People Regulations (for both England Wales and Scotland) 2001 information provided in Individual Electoral Registration (IER) applications is checked against government records to verify the identity of applicants. As part of this provision of information about a change of name within the last 12 months is mandatory. Provision of previous names beyond this timeframe is voluntary. This is consistent with the relevant provisions of the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans there are to ensure a higher turnout at the General Election among people aged 18 to 25.,The Government is committed to maximising electoral registration to help support the highest possible turnout in elections. To ensure this Government has introduced individual electoral registration (IER). Young people aged 18-25 have been one of the biggest users of online registration to vote since its introduction in June. Since 1 July 2014 826265 young people have applied to register online.   The Government has today announced that almost £10 million will be given to local authorities and to national activity to boost the number of people registering to vote around the country. This is in addition to the £4.2 million announced last year. <br> £6.8 million of the funding being announced today has been allocated to local authorities so that they can expand their programmes of canvassing and other activities aimed at encouraging people in their areas to register to vote. Up to £2.5 million will be used to fund wider activity including working with national organisations to encourage groups who are not as well represented on the electoral register in general such as young people including students and overseas voters.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he is taking to encourage more people to participate in the democratic process.,In June last year the Government introduced online electoral registration for the first time. Our new online system allows people to register to vote quickly and simply - a crucial first step to engaging in the democratic process. Since 1 July 2014 nearly 4.3m people have applied to register to vote under individual electoral registration with about two thirds of this number making their application online.<br>
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when the Government will report on the findings of the pilot scheme allowing councils to use DVLA data to match voters during the transition to individual electoral registration; and what plans he has to extend that scheme.,The DVLA pilot scheme aims to support Electoral Registration Officers in fulfilling their responsibilities for improving the accuracy and completeness of the electoral register. The evaluation will be published in due course and any considerations to extend this scheme will depend on the outcome of the pilots. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister If he will implement an initiative similar to that in Northern Ireland for registering young voters through schools throughout the UK.,The Government has learnt from the implementation of individual voter registration in Northern Ireland. As such we have for example retained the safeguard of the annual canvas and provided funding to maximise registration rates across Great Britain.   The Government has no plans to require Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) in Britain to visit schools. EROs in Great Britain are already free to visit schools and further education colleagues in their area to promote registration and many of them do.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he is taking to ensure that individual voter registration does not make it harder for transgender people to register to vote.,We've launched the new online system to make voter registration as accessible and accurate as possible.   The service has been extensively tested with a wide range of users to ensure the data the service collects allows the verification of an individual's identity. The website consistently achieves a very high satisfaction score.    We will continue to improve the service based on user feedback.    
To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will review paragraph 3.25 of the statutory framework for the early years foundation stage; and if she will bring forward proposals to amend that framework to ensure that all nursery staff are adequately trained in paediatric first aid.,The Early Years Foundation Stage Framework requires all nurseries and all pre-schools to have on duty a trained pediatric first aider. They must be on the premises at all times when children are present and accompany children on outings. Although providers are required to take into account the number of children staff and layout of premises to ensure that a pediatric first aider is able to respond to emergencies quickly in a recent debate initiated by the hard work of the parents of Millie Thompson and founders of Millies Trust I committed to undertaking a review of the first aid requirements to see if there is any further action needed on this important issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many nursery places have been available in (a) Bolton (b) Greater Manchester and (c) England in each year since 2010.,"I have asked Ofsted to respond using the data they hold on registered nursery places. Sir Michael Wilshaw Her Majestys Chief Inspector will write to the Hon. Lady and a copy of his response will be placed in the House Library. Some providers such as schools with nursery provision for children aged three or over are exempt from registration. The number of places therefore may not include the full range of early years provision available in the area. The Department for Educations Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey collects data on all registered childcare places including those in maintained schools and nurseries. These figures are therefore more comprehensive than the Ofsted figures; however data is only available at a national and regional level.

Electors can apply to register online in less than three minutes using any device with internet access. This particularly helps regular home movers like students to register quickly and conveniently.All potential electors including students at their term time address are being contacted individually both by letter and in person to complete their registration.The Government established a national student forum in 2013 bringing together organisations representing students universities and local authorities to agree practical steps to encourage students to register to vote.In addition every Electoral Registration Officer in Great Britain received a share of £4.2m funding to help with the costs of maximising voter registration. This was allocated favourably towards areas with high student populations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department is taking to assist high-quality and in-demand nurseries provide more places.,The Department for Education have taken a number of actions as part of the Governments plan to increase the supply and affordability of childcare. The Department has extended free early learning places to around 260000 two-year-olds from September 2014. Low income working parents can already benefit from support through the childcare element of working tax credit. Once Universal Credit is introduced this will rise to 85% of costs. From autumn 2015 almost 2 million families could benefit from a new tax free childcare scheme worth up to £2000 per child which will expand support for affordable childcare and stimulate demand. We are investing £50 million through a new Early Years Pupil Premium to support the early education of disadvantaged children. Our reforms to the role of local authorities have reduced unnecessary bureaucracy and improved consistency in accessing Government funding. All providers judged ÷good and ÷outstanding by Ofsted and providers newly registered with Ofsted are guaranteed early education funding making it easier for existing providers to expand their business and new providers to enter the market. We have relaxed planning rules so that non-domestic early years childcare providers can deliver additional and high quality places to meet increasing demand allowing premises previously used for offices hotels non-residential institutions and leisure and assembly purposes to be able to change use to nurseries. We are exploring local authorities use of their discretionary rate relief powers to support business rates costs falling to childcare providers.We have brought forward legislation to enable providers to register multiple premises in a single registration process so for example a nursery chain can notify Ofsted of its intention to open a number of new settings in a single registration process. We have also brought forward legislation to remove the requirement for schools to register separately with Ofsted to take two-year-olds and are supporting partnership working between schools and private and voluntary providers.  We know that high-quality childcare has a powerful impact on childrens outcomes particularly the most disadvantaged children. That is why we are driving up standards through a stronger inspection framework and focusing Local Authority support on weaker providers and improving the skills and status of the workforce.
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what assessment she has made of the access provided to local authorities to registration information from academies free schools and independent schools in order for them to discharge their obligation to monitor children who may be missing education.,The Secretary of State has not made any assessment of information shared between schools and respective local authorities regarding children missing education. All schools (including academies free schools and independent schools) have a legal duty to make returns to the relevant local authority and agree with that authority the regular interval at which such returns will be made. The school must inform the local authority of any pupil who fails to attend school regularly or of any pupil who has been absent without the schools permission for a continuous period of 10 days or more.   In cases where agreement is not reached as to the interval for such returns to be made to the local authority the Secretary of State may determine the interval that the school then has to comply with. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what progress her Department has made on ensuring that children's centres have access to live birth data for their catchment areas.,Health services and local authorities should share live birth data with childrens centres on a regular basis. Birth registration data is already publicly available and local areas should use partnership agreements or protocols to make data sharing as effective as possible. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is working with 4Children to produce an e-learning package on information-sharing for early years and health professionals. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent steps she has taken to encourage schools to provide students with hands-on programming experience.,The new computing programmes of study which were introduced in September 2014 have a greater focus on how computers work and the basics of programming. They also cover digital literacy and the application of information technology. Primary school pupils should be taught how to design and write programs to accomplish specific goals using sequencing selection and repetition; and secondary school pupils should be taught to use at least two programming languages to solve a variety of computational problems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what steps her Department took to ensure that primary and secondary schools in England marked anti-bullying week; and what steps her Department is taking to tackle homophobic bullying in schools.,"The Government has sent a clear message to all schools that bullying is unacceptable and that they should take steps to prevent it from happening and to tackle it when it does.While it was a matter for schools to determine whether to mark anti-bullying week the Department for Education supported activities held as part of anti-bullying week. Nick Gibb Minister of State for School Reform attended an event hosted by the Diana Award to celebrate the work of its anti-bullying ambassadors. Edward Timpson Minister of State for Children and Families attended an event hosted by the Anti-Bullying Alliance which focused on the bullying of children with special educational needs and disabilities. He also attended an anti-bullying assembly at the Ark Global Academy in London which featured WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment which champions anti-bullying in the USA) as part of the lead-in to anti-bullying week.As well as raising the profile of the occasion via the Departments twitter account we also published two pieces of advice at the beginning of anti-bullying week. The first is to on help teachers to guard themselves against cyberbullying and what to do if it happens.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government plans to publish its response to the McKay Commission report; and if he will make a statement.,The Government is taking steps to examine all constitutional issues arising from further devolution including ÷the English question. A wide range of options have been put forward by the McKay Commission and other interested parties. The Devolution Cabinet Committee is looking at these issues and the Government will report on progress in due course. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what guidance her Department has issued to (a) primary schools (b) secondary schools (c) sixth form colleges and (d) pupil referral units on dealing with (i) racist bullying (ii) homophobic bullying (iii) gender-based bullying and (iv) sexual exploitation.,"The Government has sent a clear message to schools that all forms of bullying for whatever reason are absolutely unacceptable and should not tolerated. All schools are required by law to have a behaviour policy with measures to address all forms of bullying. Schools are free to develop their own anti-bullying strategies but they are held clearly to account for their effectiveness through Ofsted.   We have issued specific advice[1] to schools on preventing and tackling bullying in which we link to national organisations such as the Anti-Bullying Alliance who can provide specialist advice to schools to tackle specific types of bullying such as racist homophobic and gender based bullying. We issued a leaflet about bullying which outlined schools responsibilities to make appropriate provision for a bullied childs social emotional and mental health needs and issued case studies on how good schools manage bullying[2]. We also published two pieces of advice one on helping teachers[3] to guard themselves against cyberbullying and the second for parents[4] to help keep their children safe from cyberbullying. Teachers as well as pupils deserve to feel safe and free from bullying.   We have issued statutory guidance for teachers Working Together to Safeguard Children (2013)[5] and Keeping Children Safe in Education (2014)[6] which sets out what schools must do to safeguard and promote the welfare of their pupils including in relation to sexual exploitation.   We are also ensuring that children are better educated about the dangers of the internet including bullying. From this term children are now learning about internet safety as part of the new national curriculum and Safer Internet Day is widely promoted each year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will investigate whether EU citizens are being wrongly recorded on the electoral roll as being able to vote in all elections in (a) Wellingborough (b) Kettering and (c) Corby.,We are not aware of any problem of EU nationals incorrectly being registered to vote in UK Parliamentary elections in Corby Kettering or Wellingborough.The published electoral register is available for inspection by any person who wishes to do so. Where someone believes that an entry on the register is incorrect or that the franchise for that entry has been determined incorrectly they may make an objection to that entry to the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO).If the ERO has any concerns about an entry on the register they may undertake a review of the application under the rules of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001.   
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many EU citizens are on the electoral roll and noted as not being able to vote in general elections in (a) Wellingborough (b) Kettering (c) Corby and (d) England.,The number of EU citizens registered to vote in local and EU parliamentary elections (as at 1 October 2014) for Corby Kettering and Wellingborough are in the below table. The figure for England was at 17 February 2014. None of these electors are able to vote in a UK General Election. <table><tbody>Constituency/LocalityNumber of EU electors registered to voteCorby Borough Council3857Kettering Borough Council2091Wellingborough Borough Council2769England1410710</tbody></table> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many EU citizens of voting age are living in (a) Wellingborough (b) Kettering (c) Corby and (d) England.,The Government does not hold information on the exact number of EU nationals of voting age living in Corby Kettering Wellingborough or England. This is because there are citizens who are eligible to vote but do not register to do so. 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent estimate he has made of the number of EU citizens in (a) Wellingborough (b) Kettering (c) Corby and (d) England who are on the electoral roll but incorrectly designated as being able to vote in all elections.,EU citizens are only able to vote in local elections and European Parliamentary elections. Their entry on the electoral register has special marks - a ÏG mark to indicate that they are registered to vote in local elections and a ÏK mark once they have completed a declaration that states they wish to vote in EU parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education what the (a) median and (b) mean wage was for childcare workers in each of the last five years.,"The Department for Educations Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey[1] collects data on the wages for childcare workers.Tables providing figures on the mean wage for childcare workers for 2009 2010 2011 and 2013 are provided in the attachment. The survey was not carried out in 2012 and so no figures are available for that year. Figures showing the median wage for childcare workers in each of the last five years are not readily available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education what recent assessment her Department has made of the adequacy of the provision of nursery care for children with disabilities.,Under the Childcare Act 2006 it is the duty of all local authorities to work together (with parents and providers) to assess and ensure that there is sufficient childcare available locally to meet the needs of families and children in their area including for those with children with special educational needs or disabilities (SEN). The Early Years Foundation Stage framework promotes equality of opportunity. Relevant early years providers must have regard to the SEN Code of Practice. Maintained nursery schools must identify a member of staff to act as special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) and other providers (in group provision) are expected to identify a SENCO. The new 0-25 SEN Code of Practice places great emphasis on the importance of early identification of needs to ensure young people with SEN get the early support they need to make a successful transition into primary school and beyond. All early years providers must have arrangements in place to identify and support children with SEN or disabilities. 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education how many nursery places have been available in (a) Bethnal Green and Bow constituency (b) Tower Hamlets (c) London and (d) England in each year since 2010.,"I have asked Ofsted to respond using the data they hold on registered nursery places. Her Majestys Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw will write to the hon. Member and a copy of his response will be placed in the House Libraries. Some providers such as schools with nursery provision for children aged three or over are exempt from registration. The number of places therefore may not include the full range of early years provision available in the area. The Department for Educations Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey[1] collects data on all registered childcare places including those in maintained schools and nurseries. These figures are therefore more comprehensive than the Ofsted figures; however data is only available at a national and regional level. The attached table provides data for 2010 2011 and 2013 for England and London. Data is not available for 2012.

The Speakers Committee examines and approves the estimates and five year corporate plan of the Electoral Commission. It is for the Committee as a whole to make such an assessment.
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to allow local authorities to keep a part of the funding they receive from issuing fixed penalty notices for non-registration in order to pay for that element of enforcement.,The Government has no plans to change the policy regarding funds received from fixed penalty notices issued for electoral registration purposes. Any money collected by Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) is given to the Consolidated Fund held by central government. This ensures that the civil penalty is not used as a revenue raising measure. There are safeguards in place to ensure that only those who refuse repeated invitations can be penalised and EROs must take specific steps to encourage an application before they can issue a formal notice of requirement. It is at EROs discretion whether to issue a civil penalty notice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education whether every four-year-old in England is entitled to full-time education.,The procedures for admission to education of children below compulsory school age are described in the School Admissions Code. The code states that admission authorities must provide for the admission of all children in the September following their fourth birthday. However parents can request that the date their child is admitted to school is deferred until later in the academic year or until the term in which the child reaches compulsory school age. Parents can also request that their child takes up the place part-time until the child reaches compulsory school age. The Department for Education has recently consulted on changes to the School Admissions Code including making it more explicit that children are entitled to a full time place in the September following their fourth birthday. We plan to publish a revised code in December 2014.

The teaching of creationism and evolution in nurseries was identified by respondents as an issue in the Governments recent consultation on childminder agencies and the role of local authorities in early education and childcare. The Government is considering these responses.
